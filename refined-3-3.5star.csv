B001R5JXB4,Premier Housewares Four Tier Slatted Wooden Shoe Rack - Beige,"Laundry, Storage & Organisation,Clothing & Wardrobe Storage,Wardrobe Storage Accessories,Shoe Racks",3,24.99,12.04,52,True,504,"This product is a total waste of money ..... Not only are the slats not cut correctly, but the wood does not slot into them ... I bought 2 and was able to superglue one of them together but its still not sturdy. The other one will not even assemble together. The only thing these are useful for are firewood! Do not buy - total waste of money and time!","To construct this 'kit' you will need a craft knife to correct the slots. To make it structurally viable, you will need wood glue and some pins. The wood will need sanding - as it is very rough. And then a coat of varnish! To conclude this is really one for the hobbyist and for someone with a sense of humour.","This is just the ticket for a bit of self-inflicted pain - seasoned with self loathing and spiced with profanities. If I was to pick a high point it would be that it was delivered very quickly.On the less good side, you get eight bits of splintery wood and what are laughably called instructions. Assembling the rack involves leaning these bits of wood together in a way that may one day lead to it being a rack. Having leaned these bits of wood together for a while, and seeing them then collapse, for some hours I resolved to turn my life to a higher purpose and renounce this material world for a higher calling that didn't involve shoes at all. I have destroyed my shoes, on a bonfire made of these eight bits of wood, and set out for pastures new.Adieu, cruel shoe rack.","This shoe rack is very cheap and flimsy, certainly not worth the money, worth about £5.  The slats do not fit in properly and you will end up with skelfs from the wood! Do not buy!","I have just attempted to build this today, it came with no instructions which should not be a problem as it should have been quite straight forward.The wood was very poor quality, did not look like the picture, none of the screws were long enough the so it turned out to be a two tier shoe rack as the two other shelves broke. Only buy this if you have lots of spare time, good strong glue,hammer, chisel, sandpaper etc. . .",Ordered on Saturday and delivered on Monday! Personally i had no problems at all assembling the shoe rack and have no quibbles with the quality either and i have found it to be very sturdy also. :-),"You get what you pay for.You have to be careful assembling this rack as the wooden slats are quite fragile. The uprights do not fit comfortably into place as the slats are not evenly spaced.I strengthed all of the joints with black, round-headed screws and the final result is quite sturdy. I also cut through the uprights to end up with 2 two-tier racks.Varnish or wood stain will finish the job nicely.",V happy with this. Easier to assemble as no nuts or bolts or allen keys or screwdriver needed.
B0035VZ4KC,Premier Housewares 509584 Two Tier Dish Drainer - White,"Cooking & Dining,Kitchen Storage & Organisation,Racks & Holders,Dish Drainers",3.5,27.99,9.85,65,True,1112,Good drainer has good capacity to store the dishes etc but a bit too big - its worth checking the measurements accurately as it needs to have a big space to keep it.,"Poor conditions, rust and defects were noticeable. Had difficulties piecing the drainer together due to the rust. Plastic tray is bent and has water marks all over it.",Glasses don't stand up . flimsy and totally useless.. threw it away and bought  a one tier one instead..much happier!,I started using the dryer 2 weeks ago and I have to say that it shows already signs of RUST!Maybe cheap but really poor quality.Not recommended,"I bought 1 of these in York last year. Easily put together but a week later I noticed areas of rust, I was unable to return it for another week in which time the rust had spread alarmingly. Perhaps I was unlucky but I recommend that any buyers check daily for rust for a few weeks, I will stick to stainless steel.","I really like the design of the drainer, it holds a lot of dishes in a limited space.Too bad it cant stand water. After a few weeks of use, corrosion is everywhere.Raise the price and use proper materials!","Not at all impressed! The product was delivered on time, but with a 'white' drip tray! Also, the drainer doesn't look like it's a very good quality, and is subject to rust quite quickly.I wanted to send the product back and get a full refund. However, the seller was adamant to give me a partial refund. After around 20 emails going backwards and forwards, I decided to keep the product (just to save the unnecessary grief and pain that the seller was causing!!! ) I accepted the 'partial' refund of £7 an have kept the product for a fiver. Not worth even that!!!To cut a long story short, I am never buying anything from this seller! And moral of the story for you is: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!","This item arrived promptly. However, there were signs of rust in the screw holes and once put together it does not stand flat. The plastic holders appear to be bend. I could not be bothered to return it, as I actually brought it for a friend. Will just see how long it last or until it becomes really unstable and the plates come crashing down!"

You can't fit much in each square, an A4 book would have to be laid down, for example) but it looks great. We've got this one on its side as a tv stand (with two single columns on each side) and it's just about deep enough. Would recommend :)","I love this unit, it wasn't as hard to put together as some reviews state. It's a typical flat pack item, it's cheap and easy to follow the instructions. It fits in my space great and is used in a cuboard, which is a shame because it looks really smart with the 4 canvas drawers i bought to put on it. I got this istem in the sale for £37.99 which i thought was a great price.The courier service was exceptional and the guys were really nice. Over-all it's better than anything I've had from Argos","As others have stated there are a couple of dents in the panels due to packaging, had problems with getting the item as it got lost somewhere between Amazon and yodel but Amazon did fix the issue and sent another that came the next day.The unit itself is a good size and seems sturdier than other similar units.Found it very easy to put together took just me 20 minutes","I ordered 3, one was badly chipped and one had no fittings, the third had no instructions, but I managed with the instructions from the other two! They are the perfect size for my craft room but I wanted to return the chipped one for a replacement, but it said I'd have to pay for postage and they would only refund £3.30 of any postage, I don't see how I could post this back for £3.30!","Easy to put together, bought some fabric drawers that fit well, looks very nice in my grandsons bedroom .pleased with purchase.",Looks great in my daughter's room displaying her Lego models. Bought 2 pink canvas drawers to store the extra pieces and it all goes together perfectly. I didn't expect it to be so heavy though but at least it's not flimsy. Would definitely recommend as the price is good value.,Ok for price I guess.... Both were damaged on arrival and were quick to sort first... To be honest and fair by the time I got to the economy one I couldn't be bothered to complain I'd had enough...,"Really tricky to assemble compared to other flatpack furniture.Quality is OK, it's not stunning but it does the job at a good price."

I have many Lock and Lock boxes and saw these and mistakenly thought they were the same brand, as they had come up on the search.  THEY ARE MOST DEFINITELY NOT!.The capacity is an outright LIE!  Just look at the dimensions.  The oblong box has two of the three dimensions the same as the square one - so something is wrong!  I measured the capacity of the square - 150 ml.  Not what they advertise, not what I wanted.  Liars.The plastic sides are thin, cheap and too squashable.Did the waterproof test (Iwant them for transporting juices, egg mayo and other lunch things etc in my handbag - as securely as Lock and Lock have always done).  Filled the little square with water and turned it upside down.  It leaks.  From all sides.  ZERO points.  Useless and a waste of money.  I will be asking for my money back.",Really rubbish! The dimensions are not for each individual box!!! They are for a packet of 3... Very bad specified... I dont reccomend it unless you need mini boxes!,"Not as strong as the sterlite or branded cliplocks.But the price is the strong point.Received just today,so dont know the usage effect but looks like they dont last for years.We could buy this since any plastic item should not be used for ever and u dont want to spend a fortune on these.And size is small as mentioned in product detail(200 ml)But i noticed the round ones being larger and the squares are the tiniest among the 3 sets.(9 in total)I wonder why the square 3 boxes too small?","I needed some small tubs in which to freeze small amounts of home-made stock, and multi-packs like this of the same size (and so many in a pack) are impossible to buy locally where I live.  Obviously the price made this attractive as well, but I was prepared for them to have some kind of major flaw (like the click-clip breaking off the first time I opened/closed one) and not be disappointed... but so far, no such disappointment.  I've used all 9 and they are secure and air-tight, and all clips are so far intact.  However, I am reserving that final star for now, because I would like to put them through the use/freeze/defrost/wash up/re-use cycle a few more times just to see how they stand up to the kind of use I'd consider 'normal' for this kind of container.  But, for now, if you want some small containers at a good price I'd say they're worth the risk for the money you're paying.","These are tiny and not anywhere near the dimensions written on the description. I read those dimensions thinking that was perfect.....to give you an idea, you wouldn't be able to fit a bank card in any of them because none are long enough to fit that in.The best bet is to use them to store herbs, oxo cubes, a handful of teabags.....table sauces maybe.  If you think you're going to have a cook up and freeze some in these tubs, prepare to do what I do, that's freeze one meal in 2-3 tubs.....probably the reason they give you 9!Feeling pretty duped right now.","I use these in the kitchen. As the reviews said, these are quite small, but that's exactly what I needed for those tiny bits of leftovers, small quantities of herbs or spices that you want to store airtight... The seal is good, and the plastic tabs look okay. Not as solid as LLock n Lock, but great for the price. I tend to hand wash anything that has an airtight seal,as the heat of the dishwasher can distort even the best quality seal.","The product arrived quickly, but turned out to be rubbish quality and unsuitable for my purposes.. i purchased these small boxes to pack my kids lunchboxes. I normally buy from lock&lock brand and these looked similar on the photo. However their lock are very thin and hard (and slightly painful for fingers) even for adults. they would be impossible for a child to open. I have returned the item, but was made to pay the postage back.","These little storage containers are great for kids fruit and left over cheese, little things that don't take up too much room the the fridge.  Also if your childs like mine and they loose things easily, as these are not too expensive  I don't mind them going missing so much."
B00TOEOKPY,VonHaus Canvas Wardrobe Clothes Cupboard Hanging Rail Storage with 2 Shelves & 3 Drawers - Beige - 88 x 50 x 160cm,"Laundry, Storage & Organisation,Clothing & Wardrobe Storage",3.5,54.99,17.99,67,True,112,"Bought as a temporary solution but I'm happy with it & might just keep it for the long term! Very easy to put together. Literally took 10 mins as a short female on my own. The cover is more plastic than fabric but using a little bit of common sense goes on quickly & easily without ripping. I unzipped the front & rolled the door up first, slide the back & side parts down first and got those aligned properly before zipping the front back up. Far easier & you are less likely to rip it. It fits perfectly into an alcove in my room so that will assist with keeping it stable in time. I have brought similar types of wardrobe before, for far more money & ended up ripping the covers or breaking the plastic connectors. The connectors on this one feel more solid than previous ones I have bought, giving it a more solid & stable feeling. Lovely neutral shade that will compliment any colourscheme & the brown trims add a nice finishing touch.","have been using it for over a month now and its reasonably loaded but holding the weight. The shelves made of canvas have started to slacken a bit, but that is expected if it is loaded with weight. The Canvas got slightly torn near the logo (top right front corner) but its small and the arrangement is cheap and temporary so didn't bother asking for replacement. Will probably buy again if I need more temporary storage, but this time will be extra cautious while putting the outer cover","This is a great value piece of furniture, very functional. I did have a couple of minor problems with assembly but other than that the instructions were very straight forward. The shelve pieces turned out to be inside the folded outer cover, one of the upright poles was a little tight to assemble.",This is absolutely useless......the canvas is made of a plastic type of material which looks like fabric but I would not light match anywhere near it. The frame is flimsy and comes apart very easily which means that the clothes end up on the floor.,Really disappointed with this product. Only just come away and within a few hours of assembling it the zip on one side broken and a draw handle has broke. Now have to go a whole week without closing it properly. Not happy.,"Very flimsy and unstable.'Canvas' is just like thick paper and rips easily.Instructions were poor.Would not recommend, at all, in the slightest, ever.",You pay for what you get it arrived with a ripped zip and was told I had to post it back before they could do anything so was easier to buy something else,"Do not get this if you need it for more than light clothing, had it a few days and it completely toppled over and snapped, quite disappointed really"
B0089O7VOW,Large Clip Frame Poster Frame 100x70 cm (Approx 40x28 inch) * For Home and Office * High Quality Photo Picture Frames,"Artwork,Posters",3.5,43.20,22.95,47,True,572,"I bought the 100cm x 70cm frame to mount and display a world map, without going to the expense of costly and heavy framing. This relatively lightweight clip frame does the job quite adequately. It came supplied with all of the clips and two wall hanging points. The clear acrylic facing (about 1.5mm thick) comes protected by a peel off cover on both faces to reduce the risk of damage.The back plate is hardboard (about 2mm thick) but seems robust enough for wall hanging.the retaining clips are easy to fit and deep enough to allow a thin border or matte to be used, providing the poster is not too thick itself - which is what I wanted to do. The only issue is that the clips could do with extending a couple of extra mm over the front of the frame for a more secure location of the acrylic face plate and they seem to be a bit lightweight for the job, but they do work. Obviously with a frame of this size it can be a bit fiddly to fit the 12 clips whilst keeping the display item correctly positioned, but it is not too difficult. There is also a white paper sheet provided to sit behind the display item and hide the hardboard, if the poster does not quite fill the frame. With the poster, border and hanging wires in place it weighs about 2.5KgOverall, this is a cost effective and reusable display mount and fully adequate for general usage. By using the Amazon super saver delivery option it was about £10-12 cheaper than I could find anywhere else. I was a bit concerned when it was delivered, as the packaging looked a bit flimsy for such a large item, but mine arrived undamaged.** Since writing the review I have noticed that the price has increased by £5, but is still competitive!!","It is RUBBISH, cheap, nasty, poor, useless, ugly and I'm not even joking.Do not buy and please check out the picture I've uploaded.","We ordered one originally to see the quality, upon arrival it was very well packed with the plexiglass being protected on the front and back by plastic film.  The overall quality was great, well worth a 5 star rating for the price, so we ordered 3 more.  When they arrived we could see straight away that the products were different as two of the frames were packaged differently to the third.  Upon opening this was confirmed by the actual products:  The odd frame was in fact another one just like our first - happy days!  The other two however were a far inferior product, the nice white thick backing board was replaced by a thin brown ply that was warped and lacked poster paper - most frustrating as the posters we were putting in them were vintage and therefore just smaller than the frames leaving the brown ply visible.Frankly they did the job after straightening them out for 3 days - I am useless at returning things otherwise I might have sent the two inferior ones back.So if you are lucky enough to get the good quality ones you will be very pleased, but be advised it does appear to be a lucky dip!",Arrived well packaged. Easy to insert item I wanted to frame into and just as easy to clip back together despite the item being a few mm thick. If I needed more I would definitely buy again. Very happy with my purchase.,Bought this for an A1 poster in my son's room- arrived in a MASSIVE box (more like AO+) and initially I thought I had ordered the wrong item. Turned out it was the correct size and is now pride of place. These products are a bit fiddly to ensure the poster remains square before all the clips are in place but otherwise a good compromise on fully framed items,"I've just received it, to frame a poster I bought my boyfriend. So far so good, it's not broken and the size described. I'm just about to put the poster in so i'll write this review as I go! :)The poster doesn't fit, that's not the frames fault... so gotta trim it down. Done. It's a screenprint poster so I'm just annoyed that i've had to trim it, so I might message the screenprinter. Anyway, the plastic has a protective film layer on both sides, I removed the one on the inside, but left the outer on. I put the clips just under the protective film so when the poster is on the wall, it will peel off easily without having to faff with the clips.It's what I was after, something to protect the poster, flatten it, be able to hang on the wall and no frame edges. I also love that it's plastic and not glass.","Please, don't bother. It's such a bad product. The acrylic glass is a bit opaque spoiling the quality of the picture - and yes, I peeled off the protective films. They didn't even bother to drill the holes for the clips in the middle of the frame. There are four holes, one on each side of the frame and none of these, on any of the frames I bought, is drilled in the middle, making impossible to hang the frames levelled on the wall. All frames are in the bin now. And they're quite expensive for what they are. I managed to buy different frames, half price and much better quality.","The frame was the right size, and whilst I appreciate it is plastic and not glass I didn't expect it to be so flimsy. The backing and plastic were both wobbled....think Rolf Harris. The clips were also pretty bad and because of both these fault I found it very hard to frame my picture centrally. I will only be using this as an interim measure until I can get something of better quality."
B015T0CRBK,6 Piece Stainless Steel Magnetic Spice Rack,"Cooking & Dining,Kitchen Storage & Organisation,Racks & Holders,Spice Racks",3.5,10.99,6.49,41,True,7,"I bought these so I could buy spices from my local grocer without the plastic/glass packaging.  Do they serve that purpose?  Yes.  A few positives and negatives.I don't use them with the stand, though the stands are ok.  The magnets on the bottom of the jars are strong and hold them firmly to the rack.  However, if you put them in a drawer and want to use the rack lying flat, you're out of luck as the bottom of the rack isn't flat.  I'm not sure if they are dishwasher safe.  I'm too afraid to risk it myself.The lids are a tiny bit difficult to put on, thanks to the holes on the sides to allow you to sprinkle spices out the side, but once you realize the right angle to put the lids on, that problem goes away.Overall, though, they look great, they're solidly constructed, and they serve my purposes very well.","Looks quite cheap, but that's what you pay. The magnet it's not very strong and came off. Bought it as a present, but never gave it.","Two of these came detached from the base, one was already like it when I opened the packet, the other fell off the fridge.",Perfect for the job,,,,

My only annoyance is the fact they have put three separate, hard to remove stickers on the lid. Am now left with a complete mess....Would have got five stars otherwise.","The tin quality isn't very good and the smaller internal tin is a nightmare to close, the shape is so warped. But you get what you pay for.The size is perfect for a nice balanced lunch.",Save your money. The size doesn't make it practical and the sharp edges as you fight to put the smaller pot in is ridiculous. The smaller box lid after taking it out after a few times starts to distort. Overall an overpriced cheap tin I wouldn't recommend to anyone.,"Very disappointed with these and definitely not good value for money. The areas where the handles are attached inside the tins are very sharp, and the tins are flimsy. The shape distorts after only a few uses and we can already see small rust spots (after just 2 weeks).","Work well but if you're looking for non-plastic containers, you can buy glass ones in IKEA for 1 GBP rather than this price. Way too expensive!",fits together arkwardly,"Nice wee tin, stickers are hard to remove, otherwise as expected.","It's okay. One of the hinges on the tin doesn't fasten properly, so often falls off (which leaves the lid unsecured on one side).

Excellent quality and a great buy!,"Actual products as displayed on site however thought it would be a bit more sturdy , but my 2 year old loves it.","Looks good, is easy to assemble and is comfortable.  But the alphabet should be in both upper and lower case for it to be truly educational (my toddler could not link the lower case alphabet of this set to the upper case alphabet she has been playing with elsewhere).

Great idea:)",Bit slippery when my grandson went to sit on it so had to hold the chair still for him..Seemed a bit wobbly even though it was level when the legs were put on the table and chairs..I think the legs need to be a little heavier so as the table and chair doesn't move so easily while a child is trying to sit down or stand up from it..,Unstable and dangerous.

It broke after a couple of months, so I bought this one as a replacement (at £2.90). I'd like to provide a review by comparing these 2 products.This particular lint remover is smaller than ""JML Bobble Off Lint Remover"", but I can say that it has better build quality and works better. The ""JML Bobble Off Lint Remover"" doesn't have a cover for the metal head part, and the battery cover is a bit tricky to open ( I was worried it might break by repeated opening and closing). This lint remover doesn't have this problem and it has a plastic cover. The front cap that's covering the blades can be removed for easy cleaning as well.After receiving the product, I tried it on an embroidered canvas bag which had tiny bobbles where the fabric rubbed against the clothing. It worked very well by removing all of the bobbles instantly without damaging the fabric. I also tried on cotton socks which also worked wonders. Due to its size, it works better for smaller bobbles rather than very big bobbles in the fluffy jumpers (with those, I find a fabric comb would work better). The JML Bobble Off Lint Remover had the same problem.Overall I'm very satisfied with the product, although I can't comment on its longevity at the moment, as I've only had it for a few days.",it easily takes those bobbles that form on your favourite cardigan or jumper and makes them look like new again...,"Just tried this out as it came through the other day, it is very small but works very well at removing bobbles off clothes, don't know how long it will last but at the moment it is  very good and does the job well, but for the price great product.Had it two weeks then stopped working, so threw it out. Fine for a one off cheap product but don't expect it to last long.",great gadget but it regularly falls apart- not very sturdy but it does the job and im pleased with it,I had one of these when I was younger and when recently I had a dress that looked awful with bobbles I thought I'd get another one. So glad I did. My dress looks brand new. This works really quickly and I did the whole dress in about 10 minutes. Batteries last a long time. Best purchase and saves me giving away perfectly good clothes!,The batteries don't stay lined up correctly inside the battery compartment. So I had to use it with the compartment open and continually fiddle with the batteries to make it work. The product does work very well at removing bobbles once it's working properly but unfortunately that's not for long.,"had one and used now and again but eventually failed. got another one also used sporadicly on small surfaces and gave up again.waste of money.batteries don't last that long in it, the blades get stuck very often and then little engine burns out.I would not recommend it.","It works really well for how small it is however the plastic cover for the head broke as soon as I picked it up and the cover for the battery doesn't go back on properly, I have to hold it in place while I'm using it.

The rails were distorted due I think to the manufacturing process but when put together it was significantly bowed. Most of the bow I removed by twisting in my hands but even when mounted on the wall there is some bow visible.Having said all that I fitted the TV to the wall and it's given me what I wanted which is a very slim fixing (I didn't fit the plastic spacers to the TV side of the bracket) and looks strong enough although I did add two more screws to the top rail and into the wall as the rails might otherwise have been distorted by the weight of the TV.","An adequate product but spoiled by the supplier supplying some poor quality hardware that had obviously been used before (see picture). Also the thick washers used as standoffs were not sufficiently thick for the frame to avoid touching the power connector on a 50"" Panasonic.

This is obviously not as strong as one solid piece but is reinforced when fitted to the wall and easily holds the 32"" led and 28"" lcd I put up, I did put in additional screws but u always do. I have given this only 3 stars purely for the reason that for both tvs the correct screws were not supplied, luckily for one tv I had some knocking around but for the other I had a trip to the diy store. I have read peoples reviews saying they can't supply for every tv, however I have purchased and put up about ten tv brackets now and never had a problem before. If it's a universal kit it should mean universal. I am overall happy with the product based on the price. I would recommend to anyone who will be able to resolve the problems I had, otherwise I would pay a little more.","do not be put of by the price, the quality of this is excellent, im hanging my 32 inch samsung on this thing without a problem, the screws supplied are over kill red raw plugs work fine no problem with washers, one screw provided was like a bolt which you couldnt screw so had to get the hacksaw on it to open it up but other than that does what it says for the cheapest price i found anywhere.",The bracket is fit for purpose but I had 2 major issues whilst installing:- one of the screws provided broke whilst I was screwing it in to the wall and now it's stuck.  I can only assume that this is because they a poor quality as my own screws were fine.- the level provided is off therefore on the first attempt the tv was not straight so I took it down and hung the wall mount again with my own level.There is also 1 product design fault:- when hanging the tv the bottom run of the mount has a safety screw used to secure the tv to the bracket. Unfortunately because of the bevel at the back of the tv they are impossible to get to. My tv is a panasonic viera 4k so may be specific to this make / model but worth noting.I wouldn't buy this product again.,"It is far too large for a 32"" TV, not only did I have to cut the TV mounted brackets down to make it fit, the wall mounted bracket is clearly visible with a 32"" TV due to it's width. Maybe ok for a much larger TV but looks awful on a smaller TV.","Looking for a wall bracket that keeps the tv reasonably tight against the wall, this seemed to have everything I needed for the Samsung in my bedroom. Despite the small delivery package and quite thin looking frame, with decent framing anchors it is very secure when put up on the timber framed partition (plasterboard is stronger than you think). The only problem I encountered was the screws for fixing the tv to the frame. Three sets were supplied of various size, two M5 diameter and a set of M6. My tv required M4 :( So extra cost there once I'd sourced them from my local DIY shop.The long screws to hold the tv in place also don't look that secure, but seem to do the job at the moment.","The bracket is solid but the fittings supplied are not adequate! The washers/foam  supplied are too big for the screws supplied. We wasted alot of time sourcing alternative washers and screws. Need to be fairly technical to hang this.  In the end we had to cut away part of the bracket as the power cable for the Samsung tv protruded too far and was not allowing the bracket to sit flush against the wall.  TV now up, but was alot of hard work.  Not sure would want to do this again!"

My review would be five stars, as the set is beautiful and aesthetically exactly what I was looking for, but the contents were incorrectly packaged.  The issue was that I was sent six salad plates and two dinner plates rather than the promised four each, which is incredibly frustrating.  I'm unsure who to contact or how to rectify the issue.Edited to add:  Have (affordable) purchased individual pieces rom Leekes to make up for the lack of dinner plates.  The review stands because that sort of packaging error shouldn't happen with proper quality control.","Absolutely thrilled with this set.  Unfortunately a plate got broken during delivery.

Quite obviously this wasn't made by the same guy as his tolerances are much wider than the earliest maker. The unit didn't fit as well and needed a little persuasion, but it went fine. So long as you don't expect perfection they do the job.

B005HV5CQO,Clippasafe Natural Wood Play Pen,"Nursery,Furniture,Playpens",3.5,139.00,120.71,13,True,16,"Not sure what other people mean about it being hard to move the panels - you can work it out without even reading the instructions. Looks lovely and is a good size. 2 downsides - the play mat is purple (we have boys...) and its true you don't need the bottom catch for the gate and at some point I will get round to disabling it. Good buy. Looks loads better than most play pens and is practical, folds down small and easily.","Although understanding JoannaB's frustration, I'm finding this playpen a good buy.It comes already assembled flatpack - you just have to figure out how to release the hinge locks so as to unfold it. The instructions aren't very good as has been mentioned - an Ikea style pictograme or a YouTube video would be the way to go since it would be very hard to describe in words how you go about things. (Tip, the hinge release is on the underside of each hinge - out of view.  Making it a different colour would help folk spot it.)Don't use force trying to unlock or rotate the hinges - once you release things properly, it'll hinge open and relock easily.We went for the hexagonal playpen shape and once you line up the hexagonal symbols embossed on the tops of the hinges you'll automatically end up where you need to be: attaching the first panel to the last with the angles all as they should be.The door is a bit of overkill in the engineering dept. There's an intuitive catch on the top: slide back and lift the gate and you can release it one handed. There's a second sprung catch on the bottom of the gate which is meant to be released by your tugging on the gate once the top catch is free. But it's far too tight. I removed the single screw holding this bottom catches grey plastic receiver  - effectively rendering the bottom catch out of action. There's plenty of strength in the top catch and gate to hold back an armyThere's also a spring mounted in the gate hinge aimed at auto-closing the gate once you let go. It makes opening the gate more difficult, gets in the way since it's trying to close one you and doesn't actually cause the gate to relock by itself (which you'd figure would be the point).Read more ›",I previously read reviews that this product is very hard to put together and that is correct. Even a man of my calibre had trouble figuring it out but got there in the end. What didn't help was that one of the sides was assembled incorrectly by the manufacturer so it was like banging my head against a brick wall. I emailed the manufacturer and didn't get a response. I called them and they helped me straight away. I didn't want to return the product due to hassle and they told me how to reassemble it correctly which was fine. Was a little annoyed I didn't get an email response and that I had to chase them but we got there in the end. It does look good and does the job just fine for what we need it for. It is quite heavy but I have big muscles. I wish they made a top to completely cage my baby but my wife informs me we aren't allowed to do that anyway. Maybe the manufacturers could come up with an extra accessory that meets UK child laws to suit?,"We chose this product because of its potential flexibility (multiple configurations) and wood construction. Although it does look nice in the flesh, we are really disappointed to say that that is all it has going for it. The instructions were difficult to follow so my husband and I both struggled to work out how to clip and unclip the locking mechanism at the top corner of each panel. Once we had worked it out we still struggled to actually get this mechanism to work properly because it was extremely awkward to use. This means that changing the configuration with any frequency is impractical. We then couldn't open the gate and the instructions didn't help. Eventually we worked out that the only way to release the spring-loaded catch at the bottom of the door was with two hands and sheer brute force. No one would be able to manage this one-handed with a child (or anything else) in the other hand, which is an entirely reasonable need for busy parents. In summary, this should be a stylish and practical product but the reality is that it is completely impractical to use hence I would urge anyone to steer clear of it until some essential redesign has taken place (and better instructions are then included).","Couldn't agree more with JoannaB, this is pretty looking but totally impractical, just spent two hours setting it up and it's still very shaky.I admire the other reviewer's persistence, but sounds like they had to remove half the components to make it usable - not what one expects from any product, let alone a premium price one like this.","A little bit tricky to set up after unpacking but really pleased with product. It seems great quality, contains our little heavyweight boy well and looks as good as something of it's nature can which is important when you don't have a huge room to keep it in ..... much better than a metal pen would have.","After reading some of the reviews on here I was a little cautious about buying it with people saying it was so hard to put together and change from playpen to barrier.  I'm glad I purchased anyway.  It was easy to do, the instructions aren't great but you don't really need them as you just match up the pictures on the hinges. Managed to get it up into the hex shape within 10 minutes on my own (even though instructions say you need two people) and even with a toddler running round 'helping' and keeping the baby entertained!Gate can be opened with one hand easily.Only downside is the mat is a little thin but after reading a review on here decided to stretch it outside the bars to keep it tighter and a much neater finish.",

It is suggested that you should leave the racks for twenty four hours before using them to hold your spice jars and I have to agree with this.My husband has attached the three herb and spice racks to the inside of one of my kitchen cupboards, we left them empty for the full twenty four hours then clipped four herb or spice jars per rack and they have remained in place for the last two weeks without any problems.  A plus point for me, is that if the racks do start slipping or unsticking we can easily use the two screws provided for a more permanent fix.I am perfectly satisfied with these herb and spice racks from Kurtzy, they work well, look tidy and are fairly unobtrusive.  To be honest, for the very low price there is nothing really to complain about.","These look lovely, they are stuck to my fridge & I have a spice rack that I can add to whenever.  The only limit is the size of my fridge.  My only criticism is that they are designed for Shwartz spice jars, which are a very particular shape & other jar don't get the grip needed to hold them in place.",Certainly didn't work when all the spice jars were fitted.  Obviously the weight of them pull it away from the door and all my spices fell off.  They would have smashed if they had been attached to a wall cupboad but thankfully I had put the on the back of a floor cupboard.,"I stuck them on the inside of a cupboard door where I keep my scales and baking equipment. I have filled the holder up with Schwartz jars containing ginger & other baking spices. The holders have been up for about a month so far and all is well, they haven't come unstuck. If they do I'll secure them with the little screws which are provided but so far I haven't needed to. Very happy with them, cupboard is lovely and tidy.",The bottles fall out. Rubbish,,,
