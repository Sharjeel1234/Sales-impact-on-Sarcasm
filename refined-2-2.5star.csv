B004R7Q83K,IKEA BUMERANG NAtural Coloured Curved Wooden clothes / coat hanger,"Laundry, Storage & Organisation,Clothing & Wardrobe Storage,Hangers,Coat Hangers",2.5,0,8.92,0,0,True,7,These are not the hangers I was expecting. I couldnt see any notches on the picture - i zoomed in to check. I didnt want notches on the hangers because they cause odd marks on fine fabrics and jumpers.  Having received them I cannot believe they are Ikea hangers - or perhaps they are old stock or even they rejects.They arrived promptly.,These aren't the classic ikea hangers that i was expected and don't fit with all my others. They stick out and look weird and rubbish in comparison. But i don't really care that much because they're only hangers and i'd be a weirdo to be upset by them not matching. The clothes hang on them so they for fill their function. Hangers are boring.,"The surfaces are rough (to varying degree; but some sufficiently to snag cloth).  The cross bars are not well attached in some cases.  The hooks feel insecure, but have not yet pulled out (although there is a report that they do so).  If the product has anything to do with Ikea, it surely can be only as a reject or a 'second'.",Cheap wooden hangers. Sharp edges and untreated wood. Fairly sturdy.Not the same as the nice rounded and varnished hangers I purchased from IKEA years ago. I don't know if IKEA has dropped in quality or this seller is passing off a cheap imitation.,,,,
B00GMM4RYK,"IKEA LAMPAN - Table lamp, white","Indoor Lighting,Lamps,Bedside and Table Lamps",2,0,7.98,0,0,True,6,"Not to mentioned the quality of the lamp, which is really really poor, It doesn't come with a bulb. I went out to find one and none works. Don't waste your money on it. Find a better quality one with a little more money.",These were a total waste of money.. Do not buy!!,Bought it for my daughter's room. It's incredibly cheap quality - like literally super thin plastic (including the 'shade') that would fall over in a gust of wind.It works in that it lights the room but it has reminded me that it's generally better to spend just a little more for something that isn't as cheaply made as it possibly could be.I don't think you'd buy this if you saw it in an Ikea shop.,,,,,
B000TAUM5E,Metaltex Garlic Press and Cherry Stoner in Aluminium,"Cooking & Dining,Kitchen Tools & Gadgets,Fruit Peelers & Slicers,Stoners",2.5,0,3.60,0,0,True,60,"This is like when you join a dating agency and get a photo of some pretty smoking hot babe and you meet her and she looks like she's been hit by a croquet mallet and you discover the ""photo of her"" was ""a photo of her if she was someone else"" which is both slanderous and sexist and so this review probably won't make it to Amazon.  But having opened my ""great addition to the kitchen"" and discovered it to a ""one-off Lidl special"" as opposed to the ""sumptuous Marks & Spencers exclusive"" that I had expected I actually thought ""to hell with it.  It is 3 lousy quid.""  I gave more than that to the scouts for packing my shopping the other week so what does it matter?It's not that the quality is awful, which it is, or that the product I have only bears a passing resemblance to the photo shown, it's....no wait - yeah it IS those things.And here I am - 39 years old, writing a bad review over a GARLIC PRESS.  What the hell?So in essence - this product will lose you money, will fail to adequately press garlic and will also quite possibly ruin your bloody life.Caveat Emptor.","It is either a cheap piece of rubbish or I am a strong man! snapped on the 2nd time of using it, sorry just being honest.I buy something a bit dearer and hopefully it will be strong this time.","Is it just me? or is it impossible to find a cheap and cheerful garlic press in the high streets nowadays? Anything I did find was over £5! This little beauty saved me paying a fortune. It does a great job of what it is supposed to do, it's as good as any of the previous garlic presses I have owned/used in the past. What more could you want?Arrived in great time, perfect for my Bolognese!","it is a cheap object, there is no doubt about it. the moment I picked it up I wanted to just send it back and forget it. BUT, I got it as an add-on item, so I didn't pay much for it (which, I repeat, at first impression was already too much) and after I while I realized that it does a fairly decent job of crushing garlic. surely it won't be as spectacular as some other beasts you see, but you know, you're crashing garlic...right now, I use it all the time and I'm ok with it; in truth is not getting the 4th star only because of that cheap feeling every time I pick it up; but the job it does.never used it as a pitter, and you shouldn't think to get it for that purpose btw.","I have to say that using both ways with garlic I.E cutting/chopping with a knife or using a press and I have seen a few garlic presses.  I would suggest a press.  Not only does this mean you are not left with a garlicy chopping board. I actually think it is better.  When the garlic is crushed it releases more flavour.  Anyway this one is good because some are difficult to clean.  I have never used the cherry or olive stoner.  However if a garlic press is needed then this is the one, it's cheap, easy to use and above all looks good.Slightly lose the hinge but I see no sign of breakage and so an excellent choice.","The item arrived very quickly.For the price i guess this is a fine product except the garlic press is too small compared to the hole side of it, also the piece used to remove the inside of the olives should be a bit farther from the garlic press because when i press down on the olive, instead of making the hole in the middle it makes the hole sideways on the olive.This looks exactly like the old utensil i owned, except mine was better quality and didn't rattle as i used it.I wouldn't recommend this to people who want a great quality product, as it is not great quality.","The perfect design, BUT don't put it in a dishwasher!!!!!!!!!! The 'chrome' comes off and you're left with a grey powder layer for ever more. Disappointing.","This product worked....initially.I got my large tub of cherries prepared and was quivering with anticipation at stoning them good and proper to allow for some 'Skin-Only fruit treats' (SOFTs). What happens? I start stoning, aggressively, and the initial reaction was one of quaint excellence. I was getting my treats, I was getting my beats, I was getting my Cherry Skin. One issue - I was sweating - PROFUSELY. This product requires a lot of effort, even with the superlative workmanship seen in it's sleek shaft.Now, on to the garlic pressing!WELL - THIS I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT! BELIEVE ME!If you have a garlic, and it needs pressing (but not in the conventional way), then this product will work, big style, trust me! I grabbed a garlic from my pile in my bone cellar (pile is getting smaller by the hour, I am down to about 14 garlics now! Hopefully writing this review will remind me that I need to go to Clitheroe and buy another 72 or so! The press works thus: You put the garlic into the vice like grip and then use your own vice like grip (human anatomy: HAND) and push fiercely. What you are left with is a mess of smell and salt, and most importantly, a garlicy mass. This can then be put in tomato soup or lasagne to season, or used as a comedy additive to glassed water.In closing, this device is mixed. In some ways terrible, in other beautiful. The only thing I can truly say is, I feel more secure now that I own it. Additionally, the smell of garlic permeating the kitchen on a minute-by-minute basis has made me more feral and manly, this can only be helpful in my efforts to get a job in the Shoe Soling industry.Thanks."

Shop around and give your local car booter the money rather than this tat.,Was not pleased with this product would not fit my kitchen drawer very cheap and tacky not one of my best buys,I have seen this tray for 55p in ikea what a joke!! Not happy with the price being so high the company which sold it to me must be laughing there head off at my exspence,,,,
B00QP5MLFQ,White Shabby Chic Photo Frame 6 x 4 French Vintage Retro Wedding Picture,"Home Accessories,Photo Frames",2.5,0,6.99,0,0,True,18,Over priced.. Plastic frame feels and looks like something you would find in a discount shop for a fraction of the price it's sold on here.Won't buy again!,I bought this frame in March and had it sat on my bedside table. The cardboard bit that stands the frame up just fell off. It isn't attached properly at all. It was just imbedded into two small claw-like bits of metal. Not impressed,"Very cheap plastic frame but from a distance looks ok.  It didn't cost much and arrived very quickly which is why I'm giving two stars, but I doubt if I will ever put a picture in it.","Sorry, but these are rubbish.  A complete waste of money.  I had no idea that these were not wooden when I purchased them.  The stand is not fixed securely, and the back pops out.",Bought this as a gift but when it arrived it's very cheap feeling and I also found the exact same frame in the pound shop so disappointed that I payed £7 for this,Absolutely rubbish and completely overpriced. I could have got these for a fraction of the price.  They are cheap plastic and badly made. VERY disappointed.,"I bought this as a gift, I wish I hadn't as it's cheap plastic and doesn't look as good as the picture. If I had more time, I'd have returned it.",was decieved  by the  background picture. When the frame arrived it was the same as the pound shop ones. Been ripped off. Am not happy at all.

This cannot be a genuine Whirlpool part.If it was I'd send the oven back. Not of merchantable quality or fit for purpose.Don't waste your money",Is 260mm not 335mm. Searching the product code elsewhere on internet confirms that the description is wrong.,Exactly what was required.,"The correct grill for my grill pan, but very expensive for a piece of wire work! The last one only lasted 3 years( hot point one lasted 25!) before it rusted.","I am sure it is a lovely product, Amazon had the cheapest I could find. Unfortunately they sent me hair clippers which I returned 3 weeks ago and I have heard nothing. To be honest, I had forgotten about the grill wire, thanks for the reminder.",,,
B00NGGRRHY,Tinxs Black/Brown Large Computer Desk PC Table with 3 Drawers & 3 Fixed Shelves for Home Office (Brown),"Furniture,Home Office Furniture,Desks & Workstations,Computer Workstations",2.5,39.69,39.69,0,0,True,7,"I received the product as pack of parts that are not well fitted and assembling them together specially for drawers is difficult. Attaching the drawers' parts together by provided screws is quite ineffective. I don't know who has designed the assembly system but it's awful, you just should see:-)","This is bulls***, I received like 25 different pieces of board with 100+screws, and NO instructions to complete it, only a piece of paper with six little pictures. I also had to buy a drill because in order to piece all this s#it together you need to actually drill holes to fit the screws in, and there are not even measurements or signs as to where I am supposed to mount the drawers, so im 99% sure that im not gonna be able to piece it correctly.End of the story: I had to buy a drill and lose an entire afternoon to assemble a s***ty computer desk. I wish I went to ikea.",Very difficult to assemble. Many of the holes were a couple of cm out especially on the drawers meaning i had to re bore holes leading to wonky drawers.,"Terrible product. I purchased this exact thing on eBay. I wish I read the reviews on here before buying this. It's absolutely terrible. Bad Quality. Non of holes match up, and neither do the draws, and a few of the pieces were wrong. It's as if a 5 year old made this computer desk. Actually, a 5 year old would have produced a better product than this piece of garbage.A total waste of time. Don't bother buying unless you want some firewood.",,,,

Made me want to build a Mario mural around it as it is just a block of wood floating on the wall.,It's ok but is very cheap and doesn't even come with screws or wall plugs so u have to get you own and the ones you get or already have may not fit! So carefully. And it's not really worth the money you can get them somewhere ease in store for £5 but it's did the job at least.,"Absolutely awful. Terrible quality, arrived looking really beaten up. Incredibly hard to put up. Once put up barely support any weight at all. Totally unusable and simply not functional as a shelf!","It arrived slightly damaged on 2 edges so we flipped it over to havethe good side on top.  We then changed the fixing points round and found 2 of the (long) screws had sheared off just below the surface so we repositioned them.  For the price it was ok and not worth the bother of getting a replacement as it was only going in the cloakroom but, never having had Ikea before, I was very disappointed in the quality and certainly won't be getting any more.","The worst designed product I've ever encountered.It requires two screws sticking-out that the shelf is slid over, in much the same way as a picture shame.Consequently, the shelf is automatically drooping, even before you place weight on it.Straight into the bin.",,
B006ZCFOOY,"Microplane Premium Cheese Mill, Black/ Stainless","Cooking & Dining,Kitchen Tools & Gadgets,Spiralizers, Manual Graters & Slicers",2.5,0,29.95,0,0,True,4,We use a lot of parmesan cheese and we bought this for its convenience. It is in fact simpler to use an ordinary microplane grater as it is fiddly to assemble and clean.,Very disappointed with this mill as the black plastic retaining ring is weak and broke after a few uses. Also not good for storing cheese. Would recommend not to waste money and time with this device.,"As already reviewed, excellent while it lasted. But plastic teeth holding blade shredded so the blade was not held in position. Would certainly consider a second one if the inset was made of metal.",This is a great little cheese grater. Suitable for use both in the kitchen and at the table. Ideal for grating Parmesan over pasta!,,,,
B00PLXDBWA,"Natural wood! Changer, changing table top for IKEA Malm dresser.","Nursery,Furniture,Changing Tables",2.5,0,27.90,0,0,True,4,"This does what it says, but it's just 5 pieces of untreated wood and a few screws - you could easily build something very similar with bits from b&q for about  £10.  There are no guide holes, you have to measure where to put the final plank yourself so that it fits the cupboard top (which leaves a cm of overhanging wood), and there isn't anything to actually fix it to the dresser, leaving it a little unstable no matter how carefully you fit the planks together.","we didnt even get instructions and we also struggled to find how the screws was supposed to be placed into the wood , seems difficult for someone who doesn't have the faintest idea on wood work ,  and i still havn't tried to put this up ,",Description should read four pieces of wood to make a square and not marketing it as a changing unit top.  It's not worth the money and trying to send it back is a nightmare as charges cost more that the item is worth.,Great value and works well with the cupboard to create a good working space,,,,

The legs are not chrome finish (as I thought it'd be..did not read the description well), they are grey plastic legs - which is good for a bathroom cabinet.The inside is spacious and holds a lot of stuff and has more space wasted on the top. I would've personally wanted at least one shelf in it. It does not have any shelf and hence a bit of space is wasted.Would fit most basins with an extended pipe fitting below and not the ones which have a ceramic support below, as the cabinet has a full rectangular base unlike it's top which has a cut to accommodate the pipe extensions.The assembly is rather easy with IKEA's instruction, I'd say follow the instructions to a T and you'd be fine with the assembly, if you manage to skip any step you might have to re-work.A good product and would recommend it to others.","I really like it but unfortunately the door handle wouldnt screw in the screw, which means it keeps falling off.  But arpart from that, its good.","Was delivered very quick and was very easy to assemble by my self. Was exactly what I was expecting, so I am very happy with the product.","Compact easy to erect, cheap helps to tidy the bath room therefore does what it says on the box.enough storage room for what we require.","GREAT PRICE, HAD A FEW ISSUES WITH THIS BASIN AS IT WAS DAMAGE. SELLER WAS VERY HELPFUL AND GAVE ME A FULL REFUND.",Good goes together well and fits well under a vanity sink  unit,"It's good to look at and useful, I didn't realise till after I put it together that the space to go around the pedestal was only in the top my is to the floor, as it was already put together I had to make a whole in the bottom!!!!!

B004I5YAH2,VonHaus Double Canvas effect Wardrobe Clothes Rail Storage in Beige New Robust Model,"Laundry, Storage & Organisation,Clothing & Wardrobe Storage,Foldable Closets",2.5,0,19.99,0,0,True,231,Perfect solution to clothes storage problem during major renovation project. Take care with assembly particularly with bottom shelves. Make sure shelf with Velcro tab underneath is used as bottom shelf.,"I bought two of these wardrobes and feel quite disappointed with them. The frame itself I found to be very sturdy and I have packed alot of clothes into each one and they have been fine, holding everythin well, but the major fault is the canvas material (not really canvas at all). As mentioned in other reviews it rips very easily. One wardrobe has ripped twice on assembly and the other once. Fortunatley I bought these in the sale and only paid £11.99 for each one, if I had paid full price I would have returned them, as it is Ive decided to put up with the tears for what I paid. I feel the material doesnt fit the frame properly, it is too tight hence why it rips. I also agree with other reviews that the colour isnt beige but a funny yellow colour that doesnt really look very attractive. I wouldnt buy these again and I would recommend paying a bit more and going to argos which is where I have had canvas wardrobes from in the past and they have been great.","This took ages to put together, so after I gave up a friend came and did the lot in half an hour.It is a bit wobbly but hides away all the essentials that aren't for public viewing. The structure isn't very robust but it'll do fine until the next time.Surprisingly commodious but I'm a bit nervous of overloading it un case the whole structure collapses.Fine for the spare room, it really is.",instructions good.structure poor.not very strong on the hanging section at all.i would not recommend this to a friend.,One of the easiest flat-packs I've ever had to assemble. Great storage and surprisingly strong clothes rail for such a light-weight wardrobe. I ordered two and once I'd worked out the ingenious simplicity of how to assemble the first one  the second one was assembled in half an hour - that must be some kind of a record!Designer Habitat gave excellent service when the initial second wardrobe was  missing two parts I received a replacement wardrobe within two days - doesn't get better than that!,"Fast delivery, brilliant price and good quality.One thing to be careful of, its take your time putting the material over the frame as it can tear easy if done in a rush","Was a bit dubious about this given the negative reviews but decided it was cheap enough to risk and am very glad I did. Quick and easy to assemble, the canvas cover did tear slightly, however I suspect that this was due to heavy handedness when putting it on (lesson learned - do not ask an impatient other half for help at this stage!)I now have several coats and jackets stored in this along with jumpers etc folded on the shelves, it's holding together well and doing the job I need it to do so all in all very happy.","The wardrobe arrived on time and was easy to put together. It fits well in our alcove and it large enough to hang suits and coats, while still have room for shoes at the bottom. It was clean and the zips are easy to use. My only complaint is that because the shelf's and flooring are all fabric you are conscious of not over loading in case the fabric rips. Also the same with the rail. It does also lean forward slightly due to the weight of the cloths but me have counteracted this by added wooden wedges under its front feet. However I have managed to fit mine and my partners cloths and shoes into it!"

Bought to cover a glass panelled external back door so as to give some privacy, whilst still letting light through, and it does not disappoint.  The fittings are good quality, and I was pleased the chain was metal and not plastic.  The chain also comes with a clamp which neatly keeps it clashing against the frame, and prevents tiny heads getting tangling in a loose chain.  The finish was neat, and I'm very happy with the result.","I wanted a blind which was quite shear so it would not block out the light but would stop the glare from the sun and these are perfect, I chose the lightest one which is the most transparent and I can still get lots of daylight to work in but without the harsh and hot sunlight.They look really great -I  looked for a long time to find blinds like this and I'm really impressed by them I also found them very easy to put up",Extremely thin - doesn't block sun at all.
