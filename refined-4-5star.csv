B004MQSDFW,LEITERN White 5-Tiered Ladder Shelf Bookcase Display Unit,"Furniture,Home Office Furniture,Cabinets, Racks & Shelves,Shelving & Storage",4,130.00,44.99,65,True,44,"I paid £20 for this shelf in a place called 'Store Twenty One' in the High Street. It was reduced from £40. I put it together myself in about 15 minutes and it looks remarkably good once assembled. When I first took it out of the box it I thought it looked cheap and a few areas hadn't a great finish, but again, once assembled, it looks really good and you don't notice the slight flaws. Maybe they aren't flaws, maybe this is just the style ;) I think I'd still have paid £40 for it as it is the perfect height, width and has the perfect amount of shelf space for all my bathroom towels. I have put a plant on the top shelf and my Molton Brown soaps and hand moisturisers - this really sets the shelf off. A really great buy for £20!","Excellent Ladder Bookcase, Easy and quick to put together and fits neatly against the wall. Good price. Very quick delivery.","It's ok. Easy to put up but its a bit cheap looking, and you can't put too much weight on the shelves. I bought this for my cookery books in the kitchen, moved it to the bedroom for bits and bobs but it just looked a bit naff.  It's now in the downstairs coat cupboard with shoes on it.","Lovely looking shelf, easy enough to set up on your own. It is a bit flimsy and I would not use it purely as book shelf as the books tend to be too heavy. Having said that, I use it for a few books and other decorational items and it looks very nice.","The shelves look good but, judging by the picture, I was expecting it to look a bit better. The edges of the wood parts don't fit as nicely as I expected (they seem to blend in really well in the picture, but the joints and screws are really noticeable in the real world).I also had issues assembling it as one of the parts snapped (despite following their assembly instructions). Ive asked for a replacement part, which was sent straight away - thumbs up for their customer service.Once assembled, the shelves seem very sturdy look good.All in all, it is a good buy if you are not interested on the looks, but it is not so good if you are concerned about little finishing touch details.","This delightful addition to my room is just perfect. It creates several shelves that can be used for either decorative reasons or, as in my case, for more office surface space. The good thing is that you can move it around the room. Lean it against any flat wall, then, when you are in the mood for a change, just place it elsewhere.From ordering online it arrived within 24 hours at no extra cost for this speedy deliveryI saw an almost identical 'ladder' in a retail interior design shop, for 50% more than the online price!I highly recommend this product",Nice shelves which appeared quite sturdy however white covering broke off ( chipboard covered in white facing) when the wooden pegs were inserted during building and totally ruined the shelves. One of the screws supplied was also striped so couldn't actually screw unit together properly. Not happy but really can't be bothered to inconvenience myself by trying to package up again and return.,"The shelves were easy to assemble, although the finishing at the sides was not neat. Furthermore, probably because of the design, the bottom two shelves were unsuitable for heavier books such as dictionaries. I am hoping that if I insert shelf supports into the wall behind these two shelves that I shall be able to use them for larger books."
B007POZ1O4,IKEA PRUTA Plastic Container / Food Storage Containers 17 Piece Set,"Cooking & Dining,Kitchen Storage & Organisation,Food Storage,Food Containers,Container Sets",4.5,13.00,6.65,49,True,713,"Just bought and received these tubs today, I couldn't see what size they were so i'll write down what the Pruta leaflet states:2x 14x14x16cm / (5 1/2x5 1/2x6 1/4"") Bucket/tower shape2x 12x12x14cm / (4 3/4x4 3/4x 51/2"") Bucket/tower shape2x 23x16x8cm / (9x6 1/4x3 1/4"") Sandwich tub shape2x 14x14x6cm / (5 1/2x5 1/2x2 1/4"") Sandwich tub shape2x 12x12x4cm / (4 3/4x4 3/4x 1 1/2"") Sandwich tub shape3x 12x8x4cm / (4 3/4x3 1/4x1 1/2"" Sandwich tub shape4x 9x9x4cm / (3 1/2x3 1/2x1 1/2"") Sandwich tub shapeHaven't had a chance to use them but simply opening and putting the lids back on they seem sturdy.I was looking for something to bring sandwiches into work in and these seem fine. The two large sandwich tubs are a tiny bit larger than an average paperback book in both length and width to give an idea.Not sure what i'll put in the tiny tubs or bucket shaped ones but probably dry food for the kitchen!","We bought this product a few months ago, so these comments are based on quite some usage.These containers are super.  First, let's get the slightly negative point out of the way: the smallest sizes are not much use (IMHO) for using in the kitchen. Maybe they'd be OK for a few nuts or bread crumbs ... but they're small. (OTOH I am *very* happy to say that they are very useful in my toolboxes for sorting out my random collections of screws, washers, nuts and bolts, etc etc. Very happy.  :-)  )  That leaves about 11 or 12 of the other sizes for kitchen use, which is what we bought them for.First, the sizes are very handy - just what's needed for leftovers, prepared meals, etc.Second, they are well designed so they store easily - quite stackable, even the different shapes and sizes.Third the lids are mostly interchangeable. Not completely, obviously (the rectangles don't fit the squares, the big ones don't fit the little boxes, etc) but pretty well: the smaller tall boxes use the lids from the small flat boxes, etc.Next, the lids are effective. My other half has a rigorous test: fill the boxes half full with water, turn upside down and shake. Not a drop leaked out.Last, the boxes are quite light, not too much extra weight to carry around.They seem fine in the microwave and freezer, but we don't have a dishwasher to test that.  As for lifetime, only time will tell, but so far, and at the price, we are delighted.(Tiny, tiny word of warning: one or two of the edges were a bit sharp when they were brand new and I got a couple of 'papercuts' from careless handling. After a few weeks the rough edges got worn smooth. Not a big deal)These are good.","I'm delighted with these, I kind of thought they may be flimsy or badly made but they are sturdy, don't bend after dishwashing & the variety are great. For that price too, very pleased.","I'll keep it brief.  These are okay for the price.  However, the two main issues for me are: 1 - it has a strong propensity to stain (pic attached of container after tomato soup stored for one day) and the lids are far from easy to open/close. I have since bought some more expensive containers which are far better quality and more practical.",I only wanted a lunch box but not the type everyone sells now with clips (too fiddly).  In the event these gave me 17 containers (2 lunch box size) for what a single box could cost.  Very pleased.,"This is an excellent product, not only extremely good value for money the boxes are dishwasher proof. Didn't have to go to Ikea to get them either!","They do their job nicely. The food is well packed, the containers do not open by themselves, and they do not leak.However, the plastic can get a bit of a colour from the food. More precisely, one or two of mine got red(ish) from some tomato based sauce (bolognese) I held in it. Not a big deal, but not for the perfect rating either.It would be nice to have a better range of middle-sized ones.","Bought  them for my friend as part of a xmas gift.  My mate was very pleased with them .The boxes have strong lids and keep food fresh ,as it should do.There were mixed reviews on this product but the buyer needs to remember that is cheap and is not  lock n lock. Its not all singing and dancing  but it dose the job of keeping your left overs fresh, packs your lunch safely and its good value for money when tied to a budget."

B000NPF3JU,Le'Xpress Frother,"Cooking & Dining,Coffee, Tea & Espresso,Milk Frothers,Handheld Milk Frothers",4,4.99,4.47,10,True,662,"This is great for whipping up some thick milk for a drink in the office. The batteries last about a week. The build quality is pretty low on this item. It feels cheap and nasty. But it does the trick, and hasn't let me down thus far.The trick is knowing how to froth milk correctly in this manor. Many people just stick it in the milk and hope it'll work. But the key is to raise the head of the device so its just sitting 50/50 on the top of the milks surface.","I'm really pleased with this. Being one of the cheaper frothers I looked at, I was concerned that it might not be effective enough, especially when I felt how lightweight it was out of the box. However, the opposite is true, as demonstrated by the fact that I soon found out you need to submerge the tip in the milk before switching on, to avoid splashes - it is powerful!It is very efficient indeed, far more so than anticipated. Essentially I just wanted to add a bit of texture and a head of froth onto my lattes, however I'm now making full-on cappuccino-type coffees, as within a short time you can generate such a large amount of froth.This is going to be impressive when making fresh coffee for guests - highly recommended!","feels a bit plasticy when you get it out the box, but simply pop a couple of aa's in and away you go. i would advise whisking the drink ina jug then pouring into a mug, as i found that even a half full mug will overflow with the force of the frother.  seems to be a good buy so far.",These little Latte makers are as good as any machine that makes any of the euopean coffee's at a fraction of the cost well worth the money,I use this to whisk up small amounts of milk (a cup full) which it does effectively. Hot milky drinks now seem to taste better!,the item is not working properly and it's only 2 weeks old. I should of spent a little more and got one which is better quality.,"I got this to enhance the quality of my home made lattes and macchiatos. Typically when making a drink, I oould not top it with caramel drizzle, for example, as there was very little foam. Now I can make all my coffee shop drinks with ease.  Although a little cheap looking, it functions as it should, providing my drinks with a velvety layer of foamed milk on top. Highly recommend and at under £3, I am very happy.","Had mine for nearly six months and still on the original battery. Works just fine for my three frothy coffees a day habit. The trick, as well, for a long and serviceable lifetime is not to poke it deep into the jug/cup, all you need to do is froth the top 1cm or so. Otherwise you'll just wear out the motor and deplete the battery as it struggles to move a large volume of fluid around it.Edit: thought I'd come back and update this review. Well, after 11 months of daily usage (~3-4 serious froths a day to enhance my caffeine habit) it finally stopped working. That said at the time it only cost a couple of quid. Have ordered a new one, even though price has nearly doubled it's still a cheap and cheerful device that gets the job done with little or no farting about."
B00HV6VOOC,MIU COLOR® Drawer Dividers Closet Organizers Bra Underwear Storage Boxes 4 Set,"Laundry, Storage & Organisation,Clothing & Wardrobe Storage,Drawer Organisers",4.5,20.99,12.99,38,True,221,"If you are anything like me, your wardrobe could do with some serious organizing, especially with the smaller garments which tend to disappear or lodge themselves in the middle of every other kind of clothing.These are beautifully sized with enough pockets to fit all the tiny bits of clothing we have. The outer frame is sturdy. The colour is neutral enough to blend in with whatever your wardrobe might look like. The only gripe I have is that the intersecting 'rows' and 'columns' are made of loose, fully flexible cloth so the pockets don't always retain their shape, they are a bit flappy. I'd have liked them to be firmer pockets because folded items of clothing like socks otherwise tend to unravel.Other than that, this is an good buy. Go for it! Your tidy shelves will thank you.","Excellent product! Good value, and very versatile. I was particularly impressed at how easy to assemble and sturdy they are - too many of this kind of product are flimsy and poorly made. These are the best of their kind that I've tried. The 24 compartment is great for rolled-up scarves.They arrived in good time, and well packaged - I'd certainly buy from this seller again.","Very pleased with these drawer dividers. Bought another make at the same time but these are far superior. The different sized divisions make it easy to store socks, bras, pants and even items such as boxed jewellery, perfume bottles and most things that get stuffed into a drawer. I've never had such tidy or organised drawers. I open the drawers and can find what I want immediately. Would highly recommend  them.",Well designed.Well made .Perfect solution to keeping motor home cupboards tidy . Great value for money.,Great product but it has a strong smell. You need a few days to get rid of it...,"I was pleasantly surprised on the arrival of this product; the reason listed as below:- Durable material- Thoughtful design- Mutual colour with an elegant darker boarderI have ordered few of this set for myself, my partner and my daughter; never felt so organised in my Drawer!!P.S I have ordered other products to achieve the same goal but did not fit the purpose so THANK YOU to THE SELLER!",I just moved into a new house and these have been really helpful for getting things organised.,These are really great; although if you are using the Bra one and you have large Bra's its a bit of a squeeze! But other than that they help you organise your drawers beautifully!
B004PYY350,Premier Houseware 509519 Five Hook Over Door Hanger,"Hardware,Hooks,Over Door Hooks",4.5,6.99,4.69,33,True,488,"This over door hanger is ideal if you want more hanging space or just an extra set of hooks for a special occasion when there is more to hang up, like a wedding.As long as there is a small clearance between the top of the door and the frame there is no problem in using it. Very good value.","If you want a functional over-door hanger, this might suit you - it does seem quite strong. But it is rather uglier than it looks in the photo - rough edges, roughly assembled (the various parts don't line up properly), ugly welding and uneven finish. It looks more like a school metalwork project than a commercial item. But if you don't care what it looks like it's probably OK.",Thanks to the merchandiser for putting the dimensions of the over-the-door part on their ad.  Many others don't.  The doors in my flat are fire doors and are wider than others.  This hanger is 4.6 and most hangers in the housewares stores are 4.0. This hanger fits perfectly and is very strong.,I bought 2 of these over-door hooks for my room at university as we have a very limited amount of space. they hold loads of jumpers and jackets! so glad i bought them. great value for money x,I have brought several other over the door hanger and this is the best I have ever brought. Strong and holds so much.  EXCELLENT,The item was as described.A strong build that fits the purpose. It arrived promptly with no damage. put into use straight away.,"This is the second time I've ordered these over the door hooks and I can't complain.I first ordered them about a year ago to hang over my bedroom door for coats, scarfs etc. At the time it actually arrived damaged, but could be sent back and replaced very promptly so it was fine in the end.I moved into a new flat earlier this year and need some hooks for my bathroom so I ordered these again, and they're absolutely fine.From what I've read, sometimes these products aren't wide enough for some doors, but in both instances these have hooked over the top with no problems. They are cheap though, so you can still see some of the workmanship to it, but I'm not bothered about that as they are now covered in towels, dressing gowns etc and holding up just fine!","I finally found a door hanger that fits on my 45mm door! It is very difficult to find on the high street shops, mainly if you care about the desing.Seller delived before the expected delivery date. Definitely recommend!"
B00009Y353,Lock & Lock Food Storage Set 6 Piece,"Cooking & Dining,Kitchen Storage & Organisation,Food Storage,Food Containers,Containers",4.5,25.75,20.88,19,True,245,"I wasn't sure just how useful this 6 piece airtight storage set would be, but having received it and got the hang of closing the very airtight lids I now find that I could use another two sets !The range of sizes is good and pretty well accommodates anything we have found and want to keep airtight.One use, which I'd never considered, is using one for the storage of home made croutons (they do taste so much better that those bought in sealed packages).  Normally I'd store something like these in a bowl enclosed with cling film but these containers are vastly better and I've managed to keep croutons crisp and fresh for up to a week without problem, something I could never do with the bowl and cling film method.As time passes we are finding more and more uses for them and can't recommend them highly enough - there's also a breakfast cereal container sold separately which is also a fantastic piece of kitchen kit.At the very reasonable price for these very high quality airtight containers, I have no hesitation in recommending them.","Lock & Lock won my heart 5 years ago - things stay fresh for months in these containers - air and water tight so no leaks when transporting liquids.  I've tried all the different brands of ""lockable"" containers and none are as good as these in my experience.","a good 6 piece set of solid containers that do the job, air and water tight and keep things freshonly down side, stains easily","Lock + Lock are very good food storage boxes - the seals are good, and they can be used in fridge, freezer, dishwasher and indeed microwave (as long as you unlock the lid and just have it resting, unsealed)They do indeed stack neatly on top of each other - however, the same size boxes do not stack INSIDE each other, empty, which is an option I wanted for boxes not in use. I recommend these Food Container 0.5L 11x11cm H 6.5cm 5pcs Clear plastic Guaranteed quality - click onto the supplier, who carries a range of sizes, 0.3, 0.5, 0.75 1l for economical robust little stacker boxes and lids which fit inside each other, emptied, waiting to be used).Lock + Lock are a much sturdier,solider (and much pricier) option. This particular set combination though was ideal - for that large 5.5 litre container which comes with a perforated inner base tray - making this ideal as an extra salad crisper box for the fridge, the perforated inner base/drainage tray helps keep lettuces and the like perkier for longer, and the size is perfect for all the salad ingredients.Good though it is I kept my eye on pricing, and at the time I bought this there was an offer on which made it a very good deal indeed. It's always worth looking at all the buying options, the first shown is not always the best deal!","I have accumulated dozens of these containers in all different sizes and think they are the best containers I've encountered.  Many other containers are very difficult to open when first taken from the freezer, whereas these open easily so one can scoop out things like prawns or peas easily.  They stack neatly thus using space efficiently.  They really are air and water tight.",This Lock & Lock Food Storage Set is great as there is a variety of useful sized boxes for anumber of uses. I have used most for  the fridge and the smallest ones for  storing small craft pieces.They are easy to use and to stack.,"'Tupperware'? What is this 'Tupperware' of which you speak. It's 2015 and we be locking and also locking our foods in this house. If I ever can't find a Lock & Lock box of the size I want, I just order another one of these packs. To not do so would be foolishness.","These are by far my favorite kind of food storage containers. I'm quite picky about them as I usually take my lunch to work - I won't tolerate spilly / drippy lunches all over my bag. I've had this set for about 6 wks, but I've had others in the past that lasted for years. This brand is really great. Although technically, you can microwave them (and the lids) - I did so and it was either too long, too hot, too powerful, or too tightly sealed b/c the top warped. However - it still works fine and somewhat went back into shape. I imagine you might want to be careful with freezing as well (don't fill to the top or you'll bust the lid off). I prefer the 2 smaller sizes... the large one is really quite large (5.5L) and barely fits in the typical UK flat-size fridge - I ended up pulling out one of my crisper drawers, and using this instead, to store half used veggies. The large one also comes with a plastic 'grate' that is the same size as the bottom - not sure what this should be used for - I suppose if you put something drippy in there. Though the grate is mere mm above the bottom of the bin, so I'm not sure how effective / useful it is."

B002PHLZJ6,Interlink Display Cabinet Acquario,"Furniture,Living Room Furniture,Cabinets",4,49.99,41.65,17,True,40,"I ordered this cabinet for some of my 1:43 scale models. It arrived in record time, and on opening it, I am very pleased indeed. For the price, you could be expecting to say ""well you got what you paid for"". In this case, I personally think I got more than what I paid for. It is well made, easy to assemble, and made of good quality materials for the price. Whilst not ""rocket science"" to build, I had it assembled in fifteen minutes. On the wall in no time, and it now looks very much the part, on the wall in the selected position. I'm now in the process of getting my ""hidden"" models from the loft to fill it. Brilliant! Thank you to Amazon and the supplier!","Considering that display cabinets such as this are effectively nothing more than very narrow bookcases with glass doors, they are relatively pricey.So, once you decide to 'bite the bullet' of the price premium for one, this Links Display Cabinet Acquario is a good choice as it's solid, well made, easy to assemble and has several distinct advantages over much of the opposition.Firstly, it has 2 glass doors (not 1 big one) - so opening it can be achieved within the width of the cabinet itself.Secondly, when in use the glass doors are removable - so you can more easily clean them and also more readily get access to the cabinet contents/shelves.Happily, my cabinets (Nov 13 @ £47.74 each delivered) differ from the one shown in the Amazon picture as the door runners are colour-matched to the overall finish of the cabinet - rather than being white....Those runners are in the only 2 bits of the cabinet you really need to be careful about, as after assembly the top section should be the one where the runners protrude - thus ensuring you can remove the doors at will and (more importantly !) stop them falling out !!!Luckily (as I hadn't thought about it being a potential problem beforehand), the cabinet is deep enough to allow it to be freestanding ie it can stand upright OK despite the weight of the doors being at the front of the cabinet.So, this cabinet does the job I wanted perfectly well, avoids the pitfalls others seem to have and is relatively cheap - but these type of things are nevertheless a bit pricey for what they are and you are paying a significant premium for the 'display' aspect/glass.",IT IS BETTER QUALITY THAN EXPECTED WOULD USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN GREAT GOING TO BE USED FOR DISPLAYING TRUCKS EDDIE STOBART ONES,"easy to assemble ,one bad fault shelves bow with little weight on them have to turn them over now and again ,would have been better with glass shelves","I chose this rating because it met all of my expectations,the quality was appropriate to the price the cabinet is visually appealing for displaying a collection of model cars.I would recommend this cabinet to anyone who wants to display a collection of small to medium sized items in thier home.","This is more or less what I wanted but by design it's bound to be somewhat narrower than stated with rerspect to shelf width. This is because of the sliding doors. For practical purposes, the shelf with is only around 73mm. It has some versatility in shelf height but limited by the pre-drilled holes that can be seen on the photos (7 height options). You could drill additional ones, but best done prior to construction. Of course you could also use it without the glass doors, in which case leave them off during assembly.Nevertheless quite a nicely finished cabinet & cheaper than other similar ones that are available with almost identical photos.","Sorry for the delay in writing this review. these cabinets are perfect for displaying small ornaments, miniatures, thimbles in fact anything that you may collect. it was relatively easy to assemble, if your are good at DIY. my mum wouldn't have been able to put these together as she has problems with her hands, but if you are good at fixing things,  these are simple. They make your collection stand out and keep them free from dust. I brought extra strips of wood to go on the shelves, to give height to thimbles displayed. so that we could get two rows on each shelf, but to be honest we probably could have got 3 rows on the shelves if i had brought more wood. we were so please with the first one we brought a second one.. we would recommend these cabinets for all collectors out there.","For the product it fairly good, nice to look at, the only thing to let it down was the wall brackets, which were to flimbsy especially if the cabinet was to hold slightly heavier items."

This meant that the delivery driver was able to bring the mattress right up to my front door, and then I could carry it up to my bedroom with next to no effort required.Opening the packaging was easy with scissors, and as soon as you break the final layer of plastic you will notice the mattress start to take on air as it plumps itself up to its full size. While the guide advises to leave the mattress alone for 24 hours, I have to say that mine reached full dimensions far quicker than this, and I was able to use it that same night after a few hours left alone.Others have mentioned a chemical smell - there is a very faint odour, but only if you really inhale the mattress from extreme close proximity. Once the mattress is dressed in bedlinen the smell is completely unnoticeable.  Besides, I found the very slight chemical smell somewhat reassuring - and no worse than the smell of any other brand new products.In terms of the comfort of the mattress, I would describe it as firm-medium.  When I first got onto the mattress it felt fairly firm although not uncomfortable.  When settled in a sleeping position, I found I sank nicely into my place and any thoughts of over- firmness vanished.  I now often find I sleep all night without much movement due to the fact I just seem to settle into a nice position.  The sink is moderate, eg not as much as a true memory foam mattress, but to a degree expected from a mattress made purely of foam.  I absolutely cannot feel anything through the mattress such as slats, the 14cm dimension is clearly enough to provide comfort.Overall a great product, ideal if you need a lightweight and convenient mattress.","This mattress replaced one of the old fashioned, elephant heavy ones, which had begun to be a bit lumpy after years of use. Despite the enviable biceps acquired with regular rotating and turning I wanted an easier life.This arrived with one man casually carrying it, packaged like a swiss roll. A big difference from two of us heaving and panting as we carried the old elephant to the elephant graveyard  collection point.The package looked far too small for a double bed, and I was sure I'd been sent a cot mattress by mistake, particularly as though the pack said 'heavy' I too could casually lift it.I unrolled what looked a little like a rectangular pancake, casually flipping it over, noticing its easily removed washable cover, and continued to fear I had made a big mistake. At 14cm width when expanded, surely it would be way too thin to provide comfort.I'd ordered this one, rather than a thicker, as it said it provided medium to soft support and I prefer cossetting to firmness!As instructed, it rested for 24 hours, exhausted after its rolled-up journey, and I slept elsewhere.The following night, I lay down on what still seemed suspiciously thin, but felt like a warm and comforting cloud, and that was my last memory until the morning.I needn't have worried about buying my first 'untried' mattress - the bed-shop I'd previously used having gone the way of many shops, I took a punt after reading reviews.The only downsides might be - if you were a devotee of a mattress on the floor, rather than on a bedstead, don't - this needs underneath room to breathe away the warmth of your body and avoid becoming damp.Read more ›","Nice mattress, however it does shrink so be mindful of this.  Take measurements of your mattress area and see if you can get away with the Euro King as I've done instead of the UK King size.  The Euro King shrinks to 12cm thickness 155cm width and 198cm length after a couple of weeks.  I trust you will find this information useful.","Is this a good purchase or not? Still can't work it out. After ages (weeks) debating on a long-term purchase like a mattress with an insufferable bad back I finally plucked up the courage to get this mattress when on sale at a lower price. My last mattress has fabric designs that probably date back to the 80s, so a new mattress is something to approach with caution, and my option was a new mattress vs a mattress topper.The advantages are as follows: It comes vacuum packed and rolled up - great for slugging up stairs; it has a great factory fresh smell (preferential for some, but I loved it) for about a fortnight after opening it; the difference from a sprung mattress is definitely noticeable as you sink into the foam, though your days of bouncing on the bed are long gone.The disadvantages are these: The product photo is quite misleading to make it look flattering - it is in fact quite a thin mattress - an inch or two less deep than a sprung mattress, and maybe a few inches off height and width too. The extra slack makes it a nightmare to dress as your sheets hang loose and saggy, so you had better have some elasticated sheets to keep them in place or you wake up with them strangling your legs in the morning!The memory foam also needs some top-to-toe rotation every few weeks: The anti roll feature moulds the mattress to your body position so you don't roll out of bed, but it's worth a rotation the same way you flip your pillow to feel the cool side. If have a regular sitting place on the mattress like me you'll end up sleeping uneven.Here's a tip: If you have childproof mattress covers put these on under your bedsheets. Though WAY past the age of bedwetting, it's been a hot summer.Read more ›",,,

B00EICIROM,"Silentnight 3-Zone Memory Foam Rolled Mattress, Euro Double, 140 x 200 cm","Furniture,Bedroom Furniture,Mattresses & Toppers,Mattresses",4,299.00,145.00,52,True,1016,"I've had a memory foam topper for a few years now so decide to go the whole hog and purchase this mattress.I am very impressed with the porduct concidering the good price I paid. The mattress has a very good thickness to it so I have decide not to use my foam topper with it. The protective cover is soft and that smell you sometimes get with new foam products is hardly noticable when you open the plastic and totally gone within a few days. The compact packaging of this product is excellent, making it easy for transporting up stairs and unrolling by one person.I can now look forward to many more good night sleeps :)Two years on.... I'm still loving this mattress. For the price I paid I still think this mattress is excellent value for money. It's still like new. I've experienced no sagging, sloping, dipping or lose of firmness.This mattress will not meet everybody's standards but this is my opinion of the product. I'm one happy customer : )Just a little point to make. If you do buy this mattress make sure you don't put it on your bed the wrong way up. Otherwise you'll be laying on the softer foam part and get none of the benefits of the firmer memory foam layer. Enjoy.","On the lookout for a foam mattress, I ""remembered"" that this one was a Which Best Buy (marked higher than the 7-zone  and also mattresses costing several times this price) and at this bargainous price it wasn't too much of a gamble.My initial impression of it was not great however. Nothing to do with the item itself but more to do with the fact that the Citylink goon had left it behind my bins in the pouring rain. Behind my bins is my neighbours bush and I didn't spot it until the following evening. Anyway, luckily it was extremely well packed in industrial strength polythene so my tantrum and threats to send it back forthwith were soon abated. With Stanley knife in hand I was quickly good to go.Being rolled up, it was easy to carry upstairs and then open onto my slatted bed. It looked a bit paltry and sorry for itself on first unfurling but it gradually increased in size as the day wore on. The smell - yes there is one and quite pungent it is too so I would recommend unrolling it on a day when you can have the windows open for ventilation as I did. A day or two later it was greatly reduced and a month in it is there but barely noticeable.Comfort wise however I am absolutely loving this. Although thinner than the decent quality sprung mattress it replaced, it feels more supportive but also softer at the same time. With a bit more give than a sprung mattress you feel more ""in"" than ""on"" it but not in a saggy or sinking way. The trade-off is that it is slightly warmer but you soon get used to this and now winter is making its presence known it is actually an advantage. The full body support is a revelation for someone who is not a stranger to hip and back issues but also works long hours and does a lot of exercise. I'd give it 7.Read more ›","We bought this mattress based on the good reviews- but having owned it for only 18 months, I wish we'd paid more attention the not so good ones.At first, we loved it, but the fact is, it just isn't made to last. Within a couple of months the cover was wearing away, exposing the bare foam. Within a few more months it was becoming less comfortable and less supportive. I started to notice I was waking up in the night with back and hip pain, but didn't connect the dots and always put it down to something else. My back and hip pain is now so bad when I sleep on it that I actually got up in the night last night and slept on the floor instead! That was the final straw and reluctantly this morning we went out and purchased a new mattress. We never expected to be buying another so soon.18 months after the initial purchase it really is ready for the bin. It flattens out to a measly 5-6 cm at best when laying on it and gives zero comfort or support. It's tatty- the cover is worn away in various areas (in spite of turning and alternating sides) and bits of the foam come away easily. If you do buy this mattress, definitely invest in a good mattress protector!I wouldn't recommend this mattress for anything other than a guest bed, or for short term use/naps. For a silentnight product I can't believe it.","Save your money, don't buy this mattress.  Ours was fine for a few months then it sags drastically and becomes extremely uncomfortable.  We had an earlier version of this mattress that lasted five years as guaranteed.  We wrongly assumed this one would be as good - how disappointing :(","Once you get used to it, this matress is ultra comfy.  I have a bad back but no longer wake up in pain during the night.","This was a very comfortable thick,full size mattress.the most comfortable mattress i have ever had.It arrived promptly,when you said it would.",does wonders for me back get one you won't regret itit does smell but that goes away after a while,I did not get a years use out of this mattress. It was to light weight for my 16 stone body.It also started to smell so of it went to the great recycle plant.

Easy to put together and such a lovely looking bed .. my 14month old loves it,"I asked the question before I purchased, as to whether the child would fall out and was assured that the sides were high enough.  They're not when the mattress is in place, but it is low so if he does fall out it's not far to the ground.  It isn't the best quality material, but for the price I paid I'd say it will suffice as an occasional bed for my visiting Grandson.  Not something I'd want him to sleep in every night.  You'll need to buy a good quality mattress to make this comfortable.",Lovely first bed. Fits nicely in our box bedroom. My toddler was delighted to get rid of cot and get his own bed.

B006WA0OI0,Genuine Piranha Dorado Corner Computer Desk Keyboard Shelf PC9g,"Furniture,Home Office Furniture,Desks & Workstations,Computer Workstations",4.5,129.95,69.95,46,True,112,"came with a few marks on it maybe from delivery if those marks weren't there it would be a five star, More room than i expected i have 2 monitors  and both the xbox one and ps4 sitting on top and there is still room for another monitor for my pc if i wished to buy anther, I also have a few other bits on top like speakers and controllers for my consoles love the desk just a shame about the marks on the corners","The Piranha PC9g corner desk is a fantastic addition to my home office and i would be happy to recommend the desk to anyone looking for a good sized work station. The desk was delivered within a few days of ordering and the delivery driver even helped me carry it into the office. It was easy to assemble and was ready to use within 30 minutes, although it did take two people to assemble. The Piranha desk is a great size and easily fits three computer monitors with room to spare; there are places for the keyboard, mouse and computer tower without the desk looking too crowded. The reversible design means that the desk was easily fit into position and leaves plenty of room free in the rest of the office.The only negative with the Piranha desk is that there was a slight scratch on one of the surfaces when it arrived. While it does not impact the excellent performance of the desk it means i can't rate the product the full 5 stars it deserves. After using the product for a number of weeks i couldn't imagine trading it in for another desk, especially since the Piranha desk is such great value for money. If your looking for a large desk for work at a fraction of the cost of most desks then the Piranha PC9g is for you.","fantastic son loves this in his room. very good size holds my sons large screen 32"" tv he uses for gaming, x-box, 22"" computer screen and a 24"" regular tv and his speakers with still plenty of space does not look overcrowded at all. I put it together myself did not take long at all easy to do, very good instructions one happy customer.","This is the best desk I have ever bought, both in terms of value and quality. It is very simple to put together, sturdy and stylish.  I know some people say that you really need 2 people to assemble it and while it may be easier it is still no trouble to do it by yourself. Just unpack it and lay all the pieces out so you can see what is what. It comes supplied with simple instructions as well as a spanner, a screwdriver and all of the fixings. Including a few spares. The desktops are surprisingly heavy and certainly do not look or feel like the veneer-covered MDF that most desks are made of. They have a mellanine surface that has enough texture to be anti-slip but not enough to feel rough. It is very easy to clean and all the edges are chamferred. The legs are a tubular steel construction which, when put together, give the desk a very solid and strong base. One item supplied is not on the instruction leaflet, but its purpose is self-explanatory. It is a long bar that stretches from one end of the long side to the other just under the desktop surface. It provides strength to support a significant amount of weight, whether it is multiple monitors or printer and computer.  Another nice factor that I have not seen on many other desks, even the much more expensive ones, is that the bolt holes in the undersides of the desktops have a steel insert to screw into. This helps prevent any tearing of the wooden surface. Indeed the only screws that go directly into the wooden surface are the ones that are for the keyboard tray which is not designed for carrying weight anyways.  When you have the whole desk assembled it is rock solid. No wobble or sway at all. As mentioned elsewhere in other reviews the desk is fully reversible.Read more ›",I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent quality of the desk. A desk of these specifications could easily be sold for twice the price. It was a great buy for my new place. All I need to do now is use it to get my PhD!,"This is defiantly a 2 person job as I built this by myself and it was extremely hard to do, especially if you don't have much room to work - such as myself. Also, the screws provided were a bit hard to fit and the instructions weren't as clear as they could have been. But for the price I couldn't have hoped for a better and more sturdy desk.I didn't attach the keyboard holder and I like to have plenty of leg space so just so people know that it is an optional accessory.","This desk is fantastic. Excellent value for money. The delivery was very quick. The only fault I can find is that a couple of the screws would not screw in fully, despite my best efforts. Also, you should note that you have to follow the instructions VERY carefully, as what looks like a symmetrical shape, actually has holes in different places. Despite this, I have found it to be a perfect desk for studying, and would recommend it to anyone.",I love everything about this desk. It has so many optional design systems which is terrific.  The material is such that it doesn't show the dust.  The depth is just right for computer work - whereas many desks have too much wasted space behind the computer.  It was easy to put together and the customer service was great.  A definite 10 for a computer desk.

As I'm a bit of a computer snob I looked around and found the Tarantula.  I was initially put off by the price but after looking around and finding nothing comparable I decided to take the plunge and bought it.it was delivered within a few days as specified and came in two huge boxes.  Myself and the delivery driver had trouble lifting it up the stairs.  I'm a big guy and so was the driver and were struggling all the way up the stairs.  After thanking the man with a cup of tea I opened the boxes to find excellent quality of manufacture and clear and concise instructions.I'm awful at putting flat pack items together and so was slightly taken aback with all the components that this desk came with.  I was surprised to find that all the tools (bolt tightner and an alan key) were actually included with the desk though.The instructions were great and in plain English.  I didn't make one mistake and within approximately an hour and a half the desk was together and looked great.A word of warning though.  Expect to need help in moving the boxes anywhere as they are very very heavy even with two strapping blokes.  Also make sure that you construct the desk very close to where you want it to be as you won't be able to push it through doors afterwards!Ergonomically speaking this desk is a dream to work from and the raised corner section is great for my printer.  It also comes with a handy tower trolley should you have a normal sized PC chassis.  Mine doesn't fit in it but I still use it for storing printer papers and such.Read more ›,"This is a really great well priced desk and easy to assemble. The unit arrives in two boxes measuring roughly 108cm x 80cm x 15cm and 110cm x 66cm x 9cm. The larger box contains the leg stands and leg ends, screws and other bits and pieces while the smaller box contains the table tops and bits and pieces. They don't weigh a lot either and can be lifted by a person of average strength.The instruction manual is very clear. If you follow all the steps from the beginning, you should be able to assemble the entire desk in about two to two and a half hours or sooner depending on your assembling skills. The manual states that this requires two people to build but I was able to build the entire unit on my own. Each step of the assembly in the manual shows you which size screws/bolts/nuts to use, how many to use and which tool to use for the assembly step. A screwdriver is supplied in the packet of screws but I used my own as it is a better quality and made screwing in the screws/bolts a lot easier. There are exactly the correct amount of screws/bolts/nuts to do the assembly and you should only be left with the packet of screws marked 'spare' at the end of the assembly. If you have a screw or bolt or nut left over after the assembly then you made a boo boo somewhere along the way during the assembly and I would highly recommend starting over again.My only gripe is that the smaller of the two table tops came with a scuff mark almost 30 cm in length and it's right on the front of the table above my keyboard.  They sure chose the best place for it. I will have to find some rubbing compound of sorts to try and remove most if not all of it. It's not overly bad but it does stare you in the face. I'm certainly not going to disassemble the entire unit and ship it back just for a scuff mark.Read more ›","I ordered this desk based on it's positive reviews and large enough size to hold my computer equipment with space to spare for new equipment I intend to buy. After a couple of hours building the desk (on my own), all I can say is wow, it's better than I expected it would be. It is totally solid with no wobble so far, can handle being on a slightly uneven floor and looks great too. I decided not to use the keyboard shelf so I can't comment on how good it is, but based on the rest of the desk I imagine it can't be bad.Fortunately the trolley for holding a computer tower can be used without the side panels and rear bar (my computer tower wouldn't have fit as it's 25cm wide due to it's cooling vents). It still does the job works perfectly without the panels so long as the wheel breaks are always free. It would have probably fit under the desk in the corner but I chose to put mine outside the desk to ease the regular upgrades and internal cleaning.Equipment I've used on table (see pictures): 2x 24"" monitors, speakers, 2 lamps, ps3 & controllers, keyboard, mouse, desk fan, led lighting strips and there is still plenty of room for more.I'll update this review in the future to let you know if there are any changes or problems.",good desk its big plenty of room for all my stuff,"Easy assembly, looks good and fit for purpose I would recommend this product to anyone needing a little more extra desk space in a small study","First thing first , the computer table is massive , its a bit daunting when you open the box and see all the parts, but on closer inspection everything is labeled, even the bags of nuts , bolts and screws are labeled, follow the instructions and there is no problem building this desk what so ever, instructions very clear , right down to which screws to use , built within an hour , no mishaps , no wrongly placed parts , once built you see the beauty of the desk , my son loves it , perfect for his needs , would buy from this company again no problem",,

B002PHLZJQ,Interlink Display Cabinet Collecty,"Furniture,Hallway Furniture,Cabinets",4,49.99,43.04,14,True,47,"Bought this as I was looking to rehouse my 1/72 armour and military truck collection, and was on a tight budget.Pros: Price; Ease of assembly; Look of finished product.Cons: Build materials (laminated chipboard and hardboard plus glass) Having to fit glass at early stage; Unable to fit more shelves at a later date without complete disassembly; The hardboard backing needs nailing, (nails supplied)worrisome when glass is fitted! There is a slight gap between closed doors and cabinet sides (does not detract from finished appearance.)I would recommend fitting some wall brackets underneath the finished product as the unit is heavy. another shelf would be useful and the supplied shelves would be better if evenly spaced. It may be possible to remove doors? but not covered by instructions.Good value for price, holds 35 1/72 models, tanks and trucks and trucks towing artillery/flak guns. Would buy another.28/07/12: And I did....This time doors are a better fit, no gaps. Cabinet now holds 40 1/72 scale tank models. To the other reviewer of this product (The Reverend?) you must have been supplied a duff one!04/04/13: And I have done so for a third time. (Not yet assembled) Not anticipating any problems, just more dust free display space at a reasonable price.28/08/13 You may be bored by this, but cabinet 4 arrived Tuesday, a whopping 48hrs after purchase with free delivery (and the day before was a Bank Holiday!)The cabinet went together well, with zero problems. My only gripe was the price hike since my last purchase.But, many thanks Amazon!","ok so this isnt going to win any engineering awards but i have to say im happy with it, i use it for my wargames miniatures. it went together easy enough for me and while i agree that it is not a perfect fit, it is good enough. you do hammer the back on last while the glass is in but i did not feel there was much risk of breaking it. a word of advice, clean the glass first cause its a bugger to do it later. the shelves might bow under heavy weight like say metal cars but mine is fine. mine came with brackets to mount on the wall which seem strong enough. for the money im very happy with it and am thinking of getting a second one.","This item is very poor quality and is very difficult to assemble. Using the assembly instructions results in the glass door continually dropping out. The top is longer than the bottom and the only way to get the shelves to sit in is either to turn them upside down, as the slots to not fit the metal pins, or to drill and screw the shelves in. This does help the stability of the item. I do not know why the manufactures of these items do not check them before packaging them and sending them out.I would not purchase another one of these items.",this cabinet is quite adequate for housing my collection of model cars.it goes together easily but you have to be careful when nailing on the backas the glass doors have to be fitted first maybe an alteration to the way thedoors are fitted or screws for the rear panel would be better.,"All I can really say is this product does the job. It doesn't look pretty and nothing really fits right, but it can store things in it.It's awkward to build and I took many attempts to get things fitting right before realising the pieces were just not the right size. The sides could do with being a bit shorter to prevent the glass from wobbling as they sit a bit too loosely to make it feel nice. The edges don't line up neatly around the outside either, which makes it look incredibly cheap. The glass can be difficult to clean on the inside so bare that in mind. The glass also does not sit flush with the side of the cabinet because the whole thing is slightly skewed.I paid 47gbp which was way over the odds. As I go to write the review it's reduced to 39gbp which has left very a bad taste in my mouth. I still think it's worth less than that still. I definitely felt I paid way over the odds considering quality. Sadly there is a huge lack of choice for cabinets of this kind so if you want it, it's probably your only bet outside of something with a more traditional design or just building one yourself.",Disappointed with this display cabinet. Poor quality and does not fit together well. I wanted to buy two of these wall cabinets but thought I would just buy one to make sure it was ok first; I will not be purchasing another one. I believe it to be over priced because of the poor quality. I am disappointed as they looked good and I really needed another one.After fixing the back panel to the cabinet the glass doors fell out. The top and bottom shelfs are a bit flexible.  After refitting the glass doors and fixing it to the wall I found that the doors are a bit shaky. It only takes a little knock for the doors to fall out. I will have to fit a thin strip of wood to the top underside to prevent the doors falling out. The shelves also are a bit flimsy and will tip over at the slightest touch the finish is ok from a distance but not up close. I would recommend fitting a bracket in the middle of the bottom shelf to support the glass doors. It will help to stop the glass doors slipping out.,,

It's as big as a 48"" TV would be today, to give an idea (the screen has a big border, then the loudspeakers are on the left and right of that).I wouldn't want to hang such a TV from a single arm swivel bracket.  This double bracket is excellent.  And - be warned - it probably weighs almost as much as my TV does.  Even so, I can't imagine taking the manufacturers at their word and hanging 55kg let alone 95kg from any mobile bracket (where are the European Health and Safety enforcers?!).It's a solid piece of German engineering (although I suspect it is actually manufactured in China).  And it comes with instructions to match in the form of an e-mail pages long (well, you need to scroll down a long way to read it all), in authoritative Germish (think Franglais here, but German!).  It's meaning is still pretty evident, though.Mine took about five days to arrive, and almost upon dispatch I got a message giving me the delivery date, five days hence.  Again, the ultimate in efficiency, bang on the nail the bracket arrived as forecast.The only fiddly bit about installation was attaching the vertical front arms.  They know about this, and supply tweezers to help you drop the small bolts in place.It's supplied with a wealth of hardware (bolts of various sizes to suit different TV's), but no tools.  You'll need a spanner, screwdriver etc, as well as the obligatory drill.  And a strong assistant.I'd definitely order this again.","First thing first: This is incredibly heavy. You really need two people to fit this easily... And a strong wall... This is made to hold ridiculously heavy sets, afterall...We use it to hold an old 40"" Panasonic plasma in the bedroom. It was easy enough to assemble and get it on the wall, however, it requires you attach part of it to the TV first. And then getting the TV onto the actual bracket its self is quite difficult, as it doesn't seem to fit properly. It takes some fiddling to do it.","This is strong, and very well priced.

The rails were distorted due I think to the manufacturing process but when put together it was significantly bowed. Most of the bow I removed by twisting in my hands but even when mounted on the wall there is some bow visible.Having said all that I fitted the TV to the wall and it's given me what I wanted which is a very slim fixing (I didn't fit the plastic spacers to the TV side of the bracket) and looks strong enough although I did add two more screws to the top rail and into the wall as the rails might otherwise have been distorted by the weight of the TV.","An adequate product but spoiled by the supplier supplying some poor quality hardware that had obviously been used before (see picture). Also the thick washers used as standoffs were not sufficiently thick for the frame to avoid touching the power connector on a 50"" Panasonic. It was then necessary to fit longer tubular spacers and screws (obviously not supplied).","Purchased 2 of these to put kids tvs up. The product is a very good price and comes packaged well and delivered fast thanks to prime. The wall bracket part comes in two pieces which are easily fitted and bolted together. This is obviously not as strong as one solid piece but is reinforced when fitted to the wall and easily holds the 32"" led and 28"" lcd I put up, I did put in additional screws but u always do. I have given this only 3 stars purely for the reason that for both tvs the correct screws were not supplied, luckily for one tv I had some knocking around but for the other I had a trip to the diy store. I have read peoples reviews saying they can't supply for every tv, however I have purchased and put up about ten tv brackets now and never had a problem before. If it's a universal kit it should mean universal. I am overall happy with the product based on the price. I would recommend to anyone who will be able to resolve the problems I had, otherwise I would pay a little more.","do not be put of by the price, the quality of this is excellent, im hanging my 32 inch samsung on this thing without a problem, the screws supplied are over kill red raw plugs work fine no problem with washers, one screw provided was like a bolt which you couldnt screw so had to get the hacksaw on it to open it up but other than that does what it says for the cheapest price i found anywhere.",The bracket is fit for purpose but I had 2 major issues whilst installing:- one of the screws provided broke whilst I was screwing it in to the wall and now it's stuck.  I can only assume that this is because they a poor quality as my own screws were fine.- the level provided is off therefore on the first attempt the tv was not straight so I took it down and hung the wall mount again with my own level.There is also 1 product design fault:- when hanging the tv the bottom run of the mount has a safety screw used to secure the tv to the bracket. Unfortunately because of the bevel at the back of the tv they are impossible to get to. My tv is a panasonic viera 4k so may be specific to this make / model but worth noting.I wouldn't buy this product again.,"It is far too large for a 32"" TV, not only did I have to cut the TV mounted brackets down to make it fit, the wall mounted bracket is clearly visible with a 32"" TV due to it's width. Maybe ok for a much larger TV but looks awful on a smaller TV.","Looking for a wall bracket that keeps the tv reasonably tight against the wall, this seemed to have everything I needed for the Samsung in my bedroom. Despite the small delivery package and quite thin looking frame, with decent framing anchors it is very secure when put up on the timber framed partition (plasterboard is stronger than you think). The only problem I encountered was the screws for fixing the tv to the frame. Three sets were supplied of various size, two M5 diameter and a set of M6. My tv required M4 :( So extra cost there once I'd sourced them from my local DIY shop.The long screws to hold the tv in place also don't look that secure, but seem to do the job at the moment.","The bracket is solid but the fittings supplied are not adequate! The washers/foam  supplied are too big for the screws supplied. We wasted alot of time sourcing alternative washers and screws. Need to be fairly technical to hang this.  In the end we had to cut away part of the bracket as the power cable for the Samsung tv protruded too far and was not allowing the bracket to sit flush against the wall.  TV now up, but was alot of hard work.  Not sure would want to do this again!"

I waited for a while before posting this review to be sure I've given it chance.Firstly, I gave it only 3 stars as it does not have a ""generous"" 20cm depth as advertised. Other reviewers have noted the same, and sadly mine only comes up to just about 17cm too.Secondly, while it is ok for me (size 10 female), the mattress is not as good for my husband (6""3, 100 kg). The mattress sinks down and he can feel the wooden slabs of the bed. We ended up getting a mattress topper which remediated the situation for him.Lastly, I can feel that the areas we sleep on get a lot of soften than the areas we don't. So only after 4 months, when I lay on the middle of the mattress, I can feel that it is harder than the sides where we normally sleep on.So I'd say it's a decent memory foam mattress for its price, but I wish I'd gotten a better one!","Once you have had a memory foam mattress you will not go back to a spring one! This mattress is a good budget style memory foam mattress. It is however not of the high quality you would expect from a reputable brand like Silentnight.After reading numerous reviews we chose to get this mattress for its price and comfort rating. It comes rolled up and you need to leave it to expand for about 48hours, which can be an issue with space as it needs to be laid out flat - we had to place it on our living room floor as we needed to sleep in our bed with the old mattress until this one was ready.When we purchased this (from Tescos), about a year ago, we could not get rid of the smell. We complained after a month to be told that there was a batch, including ours, that was made with different glue. Silentnight disposed of our old one and delivered us a new one within a week. The smell disappeared after about a week with this one and so far so good. It is not as good as the sensaform mattress i had previously at my home, but it is a very good budget one.> Comes rolled up and you leave to expand ready for use.> Depth is not as thick as my sensaform mattress, but this was a lot cheaper.> You will get a good comfy nights sleep with this mattress.> Partner and i do not roll together in the middle which is why we chose this instead of the 3 zone silentnight one.> Beware of the warranty terms (y1 proper warranty; yr2 you pay the transport any replacement; yr2-3 pay 40% of retail; yr3-4 pay 60% retail; yr 4-5 pay 80% retail)Overall i would recommend this product, as after a years use it is still going strong. However, if you can afford to buy a better one such as Sensaform or even Tempur (LOVE LOVE LOVE!) then i would say it is worth its extra money!","While the mattress itself is fine and I personally think at 155 pound for the double (which is what i paid when I bought it, the price goes up and down frequently it seems), seems to represent a good value for money (so far).While I was initially apprehensive of a purely foam based mattress to give somewhat firm support, I was pleasantly surprised that once settled, the mattress is rather firm, just the way I like it.Overall, 5 start just for the mattress, considering the value for money.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So why the two star you say? Well, one of the reason I bought the mattress was it's 5 year warranty. Given that it's a no turn foam mattress, I just wanted to have the piece of mind...Unfortunately, when the mattress arrived, I was surprised to see that the terms for the warranty. For all practical purposes, the mattress comes with a real 1 year warranty. Anything after that will cost you and by year 5, it's almost worthless. This isn't mentioned anywhere in Amazon (which I'm in the process of informing them). Anyway, this is how the warranty pans out over 5 years:1. Year 1: Standard warranty, including labour and transportation cost included2. Year 2: Same as year one, but if there's replacement of the mattress, you'll incur the transportation cost3. Year 2-3: Beginning of a sliding scale of charges. In case of claim, you pay 40% of current retail price4. Year 3-4: You pay 60% of the current retail price5. Year 4-5: You pay 80% of the current retail price!While the mattress itself is good, two stars for what I'd say misleading warranty. The seller should make this explicit really!","This is a great buy, much better than I expected. No bad smell really and leveled out quick and packaged really small. All in all well worth it","Have only used the mattress for one night and wow, what a difference!  It certainly helps if you suffer with sore points around the body (I'm a fibromyalgia sufferer).

I ended up putting in 4 small screws and hanging it from that.","great product, really helped tidy up my sandals and i also put belts and scarves in the pockets.  the only negative is that the pockets are quite small and tight so only good for sandals or shoes, not boots or larger sizes",This is the second type of clear hanging organiser I've bought and this also will not fit men's shoes or women's larger shoes.I wish the sellers would state this in their description. I will be returning this and give up in finding what I want.,I don't need to store shoes but this is exactly what I was looking for. I have cut it into two - I am going to use the top three rows when I go on holiday to store my toiletries that the average tiny hotel bathroom never has enough space for. I shall hang it over the shower rail. I am going to hang the bottom two rows from a shelf in the greenhouse to store all my gardening bits and bobs. Perfect. It seems well made and arrived promptly.,Is a bit wide for wardrobe door but it does. Not sure what to do with tapes. Also not ideal for large size shoes but fine for pumps.,This item is sturdily made to a high quality. I am delighted with my purchase. My 3 year old can see her shoes and trainers clearly and we now have a very organised and tidy hallway. I intend to attach the organiser to the back of the wardrobe door with hooks. This should last for years!,"I don't use this for shoes by the way, but for everything else in my room!Good points- can see exactly what is where- can withstand quite a bit of weight (bottles of suncream/hairspray/body lotion etc)- lots and lots of pockets!bad points- the strange bottom strap isn't long enough to stretch round and reach the hooks at the top, not sure what it's purpose is- the hooks do hold it on the door BUT the frame can't be too thick- isn't always sturdy and has fallen off a couple of times, considering i use it daily it could be more","We bought this from my husband's Amazon account. Would not recommend it.Came today with another, (cheaper!) product, which is similar but much better, shows this one up.This item is really short, so there's loads of wasted space at the bottom of the door, where another four pairs of shoes could have easily fitted.The hooks wouldn't go over the top of the door but I just pliered/bent them to make them bigger and then they worked perfectly so that in itself wasn't a problem.This is not fit for the purpose we bought it for so I'm going to use it for something else and buy another of the 'other' product (24 pockets, £10.99)."
B00UJTOWYM,Bebe 9 Toddler Childrens Wooden Play Table/Desk Childs Chair Furniture Set Kids (White),"Nursery,Furniture,Toddler Furniture,Table & Chair Sets",4,49.99,24.99,50,True,39,"Very solid wooden table and chair for children. My baby is 19 months old and absolutely loved it and the independence brought with it. Comparing to a lot of other brands or make, this is the most cost effective. Once it is installed, it is a very solid set. You can say I'm pretty pleased. Installation is pretty easy, without any help from husband, it is just screwing the legs into tops and panels without the need of any tools. Except the back of the chair, you do need a small screw driver, to put the back panels together between the two poles. Last but not least, the table and chair is exceptionally good looking, it'll work in any room. It looks very endurance too, but that needs time to tell. Overall, a very satisfactory purchase.My order originally arrived with a leg unable to screw into the back of the chair, because the screw is too short. Contacted the seller directly, and the response was very polite and prompt, and was promised to send me a replacement. Received them, and very happy now the chair is up and working now. Very happy with the process and how they dealt with it. Thank you.",I love this item looks lovely only problem I had is one of the legs on the chair wouldn't screw on properly and kept falling off asked for a replacement and heard nothing back but leg was easily fixed on with a sturdy wood glue then no problem but not impressed about no reply when there is a problem hence the 3 star review would have given it 5 if I had a reply.,"Lovely table and chair. Very happy! Was ever so easy to put together took me no more then ten minutes, daughter loves it. Great buy!","It's a lovely little table and chairs, the back of the chair was a little fiddly but I put that down to me being slightly challenged in the diy departmentdepartmentMy only quarm is two pieces of wood are pink in places, merely cosmetic but on a white table quite noticeable.On a whole I would definitely purchase this again","Very pleased! I purchased the brown toodler table which is infact a taupe colour and goes great with my living room. Very  Easy to put together. Legs just screw in without tools, you only need to screw in two screws for the chair. A lovely table and chair. Just shame I can't purchase another chair.",This was great to start with after the company replaced a part ... although it looked sturdy it wasn't long before another part started to split my child became unhappy when I packed it away just can't be bothered to sort it out to be honest I myself was upset as it was brilliant  :(,Brilliant. neutral colour and stylish. Really great value for money and a bit more unusual. Also had great service from the seller as the chair base I was initially sent was slightly faulty. They sent a new one immediately with no hassle.,The item looks lovely on the picture but quality is poor. I received mine and the wood was chipped in several places. I contacted the seller and provided photos yet never heard anything from them so customer service is also poor.

So ... time to search the internet for the ideal shoe solution! The reviews already online helped to shape my decision. I could see that room for a pair was pretty important, and strangely, not always the case!!  Secondly firmness of the structure seemed preferable to saggy bottoms!!!  These are not the cheapest but they are of excellent quality and I would recommend without hesitation.","I take size 9.5 shoes, I mainly wear formal slip-on leather shoes, and I always store them with plastic shoe trees in (specifically ASIN: B0051GKF12 on Amazon).  I have given precise details because for a product like this what everyone wants to know is 'Is it going to work for my shoes?'My shoes fit in this hanger, heel to toe, sole to sole, with their shoe trees in and just a little bit of the shoe sticking out of the compartment.  One pair, it is tricky getting them in, the rest are easy.  Snug, but easy. It also supports the weight of ten pairs of mens leather shoes without showing signs of stress. Excellent!I had been contemplating all sorts of weird and wonderful shoe storage methods, but this a cheap and highly effective.","This product is brilliant, you can put 2 or 3 pairs of flip flops in one section and it holds trainers and mens shoes ! Great product.",Just what I wanted and delivery was v quick. Holds my shoes well without sagging and I like that it has a coat hanger style hook rather than a Velcro one. Will order another when I have cleared some wardrobe space.,Just what I needed to tidy my porch way. I ordered 2 - really delighted and just ordered another 1 - could have thought about throwing some shoes out but eh oh you can never have too many shoes:)Fabric is strong and well worth the money - wish the postage was a little bit cheaper!,"This has solved all my utility room shoe storage problems. Prompted by a big tidy up on a very wet August weekend stuck indoors no longer do I need to shift piles of shoes to get to the freezer or washing machine! I also have removed the temptation of my dogs to help themselves to a shoe or two when they get into the utility room! Very good quality, heavy duty and not floppy at all. Hanger is strong and fits over a standard clothes rail.  I can fit ten pairs of all sort of shoes from sturdy Merrell walking shoes to trainers, Crocs and sandals with a pair per pocket placed toe to heel in each. Apart from the rather odd smell of the fabric (a bit like moth balls) which I am sure will wear off quickly, I wish I had thought to get this a couple of years ago.",I originally ordered one of these for myself to organise my shoes and found them so good have now ordered a couple more for my family.  I take a size 10 ladies shoe and all except my boots fit in there easily. Would definitely recommend.,"An excellent and useful little product. Solves the shoe pile problem and holds heavy shoes perfectly. Little snug for some of the more bulky men's shoes, but everything fits if you put them in front-to-back."
B003U6S3E6,"Snug Mattress Super 750 Coolmax Zoned Memory Foam Mattress in Ikea Euro, White, 140 x 200 x 23 cm","Furniture,Bedroom Furniture,Mattresses & Toppers,Mattresses",4.5,280.00,262.98,6,True,71,"After trying several mattresses I bought the Snug memory Foam Coolmax 750 last week and am atlast satisfied with an amazing night's sleep. I had previously laboured under the false impression that trying a mattress in a shop was the only way to know its suitablity - but of course 3 minutes in a shop cannot indicate how ones body will settle after a week or a fortnight - so it's just as much a risk to but online and considerably cheaper! It certainly took 2/3 nights to adjust to the different textures, but straight away i lost that aching down the sleeping side's pressure points I had had from a pocket sprung mattress before and am waking up refreshed and rested. I found it hard to choose from the many on sale online and made my decision based on the reviews I read here.  Thus, if you are looking for a high quality memeory foam mattress - choose this one!! It's marvellous and believe all the reviews you read here!  Thanks Amazon!","I would recommend this mattress any day - efficient and quick delivery, came in good condition and above all - good quality mattress.  It came as rolled up mattress but on opening(exactly as per the instructions given), it became twice the size with no unpleasent smell. Though it is not used daily, it is comfortable to sleep on as stated by my son, who uses it when he comes home. Good value for money.","The mattress arrived very speedily at lunch time and was bought up to my first floor flat.It expanded immediately which was a relief as I have already had to send one back (from a different company!)that was obviously very tired and would not rise! The coolmax cover is high quality and it's easy to grab to move but you have to be careful to avoid the foam! The smell wasn't too bad and I spent the afternoon dragging it (carefully) to the bedroom and getting it set up but not putting the bedding on so as to air it. It was lovely to sink into and no springs! I have multiple back/hip/neck problems so I was keen to get away from the springs altogether. I have been using toppers, the lastest being 75kg/5cm but could still feel the springs through the topper (rented bed in rented flat). I have found sleeping on the nre mattress somewhat of the mixed bag, but cooler than the (naked foam) topper. My back is in a terrible state at the moment so I don't think I qualify as a healthy person's spine! I haven't been able to sleep on my right side for very long without pain and waking up to turn over for over five years it is much more comfortable now without the pressure of the springs pushing up into my bad hip.I bought this mattress because I wanted the coolmax cover and the ventilation as I find the topper very hot on most nights and as I am in the hot flushing stage of life extra heat is not wanted! I have found it a little soft for me though, so have put the topper on top on the mattress inside the cover (fits ok) and I think this will be firmer or no worse! Haven't slept on this combination yet.Time will tell. All in all this is a good product and reasonably priced but in hindsight I should have gone for a firmer one. If you like a hard bed this ain't for you!Read more ›",Great value - actually better than great value. Had a king-size beforehand for a couple of years. Great. As is the double size. Quick delivery. Fantastic quality. Would recommend in a heart-beat - memory foam and Snug's mattresses.,"The mattress was a great a buy for the money. Took a little bit of getting used to as our previous mattress was like a sponge but now, after a week of sleeping on it, it is very comfortable! Very good for the winter months as well as it absorbs body heat so a thinner tog mattress would be more suited during summer months. Great service and very helpful",Was slightly worried about ordering a mattress online that I had never seen but it is definitely the best mattress we have ever bought. Extremely comfortable best nights sleep and the only downside is how warm the bed actually gets but that was rectified when we switched to a 3-tog duvet. I would definitely purchase a mattress from this company again.,"Good price for a quality purchase. Item arrived very quickly. It was my experience that a Memory Foam Mattress takes about 14-days to get used to, it is slightly warmer to sleep on than a conventional sprung mattress, you dont have to move about as much to find a comfortable position as it cradles you in your chosen position, without feeling stiff. I suffer with back and shoulder pain which has been greatly helped by this mattress. I have read reviews that say that the smell of the mattress is a problem, it is just a slight smell that I associate with the foam which quickly goes away.",The materess heats up and isn't super cool!The problem is the mattress heats up alot i and is too firm and not comfortable even had rashes on my back. I stopped using it.I bought another memory foam mattress does not heat up as this one. Search more before you buy this mattress.However the mattress was advertised as medium but we considered it to be very firm. I number of mornings I woke up feeling very stiff and sore. Also it made my partner very hot during the night. After a month the mattress still stinks of chemicals.
B0050CCZME,"Genuine Piranha Tetra Computer Desk with Shelves, Cupboard & Drawers for a Home Office PC5b","Furniture,Home Office Furniture,Desks & Workstations,Computer Workstations",4.5,149.99,92.95,38,True,139,"I was very impressed with the quick turnround from ordering to delivery of this product which was received within 2 days of ordering. The product was very securely packed and all items individually listed and marked for ease of assembly. In addition all the screws and components required were placed and identified in seperate plastic bags so it was extremely easy to identify which part belonged where. There was even an extra bag included which had a variety of spare screws etc in the event any were missing from the main packs (incidentally there were none missing). It does take a fairly long time to assemble particularly if doing it alone, as I was, but the end result is a superb quality desk for the price. I was impressed to show my family and friends who are all highly complimentary about it and it does look impressive once assembled especially with it having a modern look to its finish and design. My only minor issue is with the size of the raised platform to the right hand side of the desk as it is very narrow. It is intended for a printer to sit on but as I have quite a large printer I opted not to attach the platform and rest my printer on the desk surface. However, the wooden platform has come in handy to sit on the floor under the desk and I have placed my router on it. Overall I am extremely pleased with my purchase and have subsequently purchased a matching chest of drawers from the same company which was equally quickly delivered having been ordered on Easter Monday and delivered by the following Wednesday. Excellent customer service from Piranha Trading.","I read the reviews for the other similar desks in this series (different wood finishes) and I'm pleased to report that this beech-finish one is no exception.  Well packaged and delivered promptly, it was (fairly) easy to put together, although it did take a bit longer than the hour or two some people managed!  All parts were clearly marked with the Part Number, as were the screws and bolts.  Why aren't all flat-packs sold this way? Very solid desk which looks really expensive when assembled.  Both sliding shelves work well, as do the drawer runners. Worth taking time to get everything lined up properly, as finished item will look so much better.  Highly recommended.","I placed the order for the desk late on Sunday evening and it arrived first thing on Tuesday morning. The assembly instructions are very clear and it took me about two and three quarter hours to put the desk together on my own, though some parts were a bit fiddly without someone to help (getting the top on is a challenge due to its size and having to line up six pins and holes at once). The result feels nice and robust - nothing wobbles or rattles - and there is plenty of space to keep computer equipment (I have a 27"" monitor with two small speakers on the main surface and have placed a secondary 20"" monitor on the raised area). As you can see from the photos the desk looks nice whilst remaining functional.Whilst the positive aspects (look, feel, storage space, speed of delivery and price) of this desk far outweigh the negative ones I do have a couple of minor quibbles. One is that the keyboard shelf is a bit on the narrow side, as I do prefer to keep the mouse and keyboard next to each other. I have however adapted to using the mouse on the top surface and the keyboard on its shelf. The space for the computer case is not really deep or well-ventilated enough either - once I had plugged in all the cables the computer sticks out quite far with its front feet in the air, and it does feel quite warm inside (not problematically so in my case, but it might be worth bearing in mind if your computer puts out a lot of heat already).Overall I am extremely happy with my purchase - it's much more comfortable than the small cramped desk it replaced, looks a lot nicer in the room and was amazingly good value. Thank you, Piranha!","Overall this desk is fantastic! The pieces are very sturdy and good quality.It is a great size...even with all of my mess on it!The only slight downside is (this could have been my workmanship!) some of the holes are a couple of mm wonky so some of the pieces are quite flush. I doubt anyone but me would notice it and I'm sure the integrity of the desk is still amazing but though I should mention it.Oh, and your printer would have to be teeny to fit on the little shelf...definitely not good for an all-in-one ;)I put it together gradually over a couple of days but with two people it can be done in a few hours. All the parts were labelled thoroughly and the instructions were really good, although I wasn't sure which holes to use on the drawer runners it's logical that you don't want them sticking out over the panel!Definitely a fantastic desk for the price :) Would highly recommend!","Excellent product, very quick delivery, well packed and very simple easy to understand instructions.I especially liked the fact that every single item came fully labelled making assembly very easy.Deal in total confidence with this supplier.Well done to all at PiranhaHappy buyer",,,

Dispatched exceedingly quickly - very happy Mum!","Excellent value, and looks great.

Can load on lots of school bags, dressing bags etc. Very happy with this.",Fantastic kids coat hook.  I installed it on the inside of the door to our coat cupboard.  My daughter hangs her coats and bags on it. It looks great.  Only  issue is that the screws that came with it are actually made of plastic - I know because the head of one of the screws came off when i installed it.,"I bought 2 of these. They were easy to fit, and we pile them with coats and bags and they sturdy enough to hold everything.Only thing is the coloured balls look slightly cheap, but you get what you pay for, and you don't see them once the rack is full of coats anyway","Looks good in my hallway and frees up wardrobe space. Although reasonable price holds a few coats and scarves etc. Only minus if you put holder in back of coat over ball on rack can be awkward to get off, Pleased with it overall though.","Needed some hooks for my daughter's growing collection of coats and bags and this rack has proved ideal. Robust and colourful, although now totally hidden, this is doing the intended job very well!","Cheap and cheerful, looks great on the wall of the spare room where my grandchildren sleep and is ideal for their dressing gowns, bags of toys etc. adequate quality, seems quite strong.

Very nice desk, nicely made, all parts are very high quality. Nice smooth corners, beautiful design, colour and really comfortable to use!","I recently built my own computer, therefore required a desk. Since I'd spend all my money on the computer, I then spent many hours search for a decent looking desk at an affordable price. It's not that easy. Eventually, I stumbled upon Piranha desks, which looked very nice, and then found this one that looked though it could accommodate my overly large tower at a very great price!It was delivered very fast (ordered Wednesday evening and has it built and in use by Friday evening). Although, it was delivered after 7pm. The only downsize is that the desk is rather complicated and fiddly to build, but the instructions were very informative. I was right, it easily accommodated my computer, studio speakers, and many books. Very happy indeed.","When assembling it you might wonder why you bought it in the first place, once it's assembled the reasons will be clear. The only reason it's not 5 stars it's because of their instructions and one of their screws didn't fit properly (which took me an extra 3 hours) so you had to have a bit of extra common sense in order to avoid sending it back if you're not used to dealing with things like this. The wood seems sturdy enough and I received very quickly so double points for that. Too soon to tell on how long it'll last, although it doesn't seem like it's going to start falling apart unless you want it to.","The level of customer service and quality of desk was exceptional.Packaging was excellent, but what impressed me the most was that I have never had a flat pack so clearly labelled before. Every packet and panel had a clear label, and better still, all the dowels and cam screws were pre-fitted. Best value for money purchase I have made in a long time.We actually took delivery of the next desk up in the range, owing to an issue with the courier, but I have no reason to suspect this is any less well built.Highly recommended.",No chips/scratches. Owned for over a year now and it's not had any issue's. The cupboard for your Tower can also be turned in to shelves if you haven't got a tower.Cupboard is brilliant at silencing any noise from your PC if it's loud.,"A good sturdy desk.  the top was damaged very slightly in transit, so slight I was loathe to report it but on balance decided i couldn't live with the minute scratch on the top as it drew my eye.  Immediately the company agreed without question or comment to either give me a new top or a discount.  i felt a bit mean asking for a new top but they were very nice and the new top came the next day.  Top product and top service.",Great value for money at half original price. Easy to assemble with clear instructions and numbered pieces. Would recommend to others .,"After much thought, I decided on this desk because it fit in the space required and the other reviews.The desk itself looks good and seems a decent quality for the very good price paid. It did take a while for me and my gf to make but we did go wrong with some of the fixings (She was in charge of that).The only downsides are that the sliding section doesnt seem to come out all the way, but maybe that is our fault. I will have to take it apart. The other being a couple of small dents or marks. Whether this was in transit or shipped out I cannot say. Either way I don't feel these poiints detract from the desk itself!Overall a great product for the price, highly recommend over an 'Argos' desk at similar price for example."

Other colours in this range at the time were estimated at 9-10 days estimated delivery time, and I assumed it would be the same for this one, which didn't worry me when I ordered it on Tuesday 5th April - and I was amazed when it turned up this afternoon!The instructions are among the easiest I've come across and all parts are clearly labelled. This took me 2-3 hours to put together myself, and the desk is now sitting in the office fitting perfectly against the wall.One tip I would advise is to use your own screwdriver, as at first I used the one provided and found it uncomfortable, and have a small blister from it. There are a few steps where the smaller screwdriver is needed, but if you have a bigger one with a softer grip I'd recommend you use that where you can. But that said, that is literally my only gripe - and that was only due to my own laziness in not going and getting my own screwdriver earlier!I haven't set up the PC on it yet but all going well that should be done as soon as I'm finished writing this.All in all, fantastic price, fantastic delivery time, fantastic instructions and a fantastic desk - if this is within your budget, I'd definitely recommend this one.","This desk looks very good in any room, even in office. I have Laptop + second big screen (24"") but still have enough place on the top of the desk. I`m very pleased with this purchase. 5* from me.","Very happy with this desk. Fast delivery, good value for money and most importantly very straightforward instructions to put together (from someone who does not like DIY). Highly recommend this.","I've just finished putting this desk together and set up my new computer on/in it. Its a very srtong, sturdy desk which is holding the weight of my 32"" tv (will have other things on it soon too).I would deffo reccommend this to other people.","Solid table, plenty of storage space.If you have a tower PC with a large ATX style case, you may have trouble fitting it into the compartment.Desk space is decent, becomes cramped with 2 monitors - 2 widescreen monitors would not fit very well.Overall, good for the money but if you need a lot of deskspace, go for something else.","Very pleased with the desk. It looks expensive, is well made and represents good value for money."

The shelf is reasonably deep (35cm) and has a significant load.  I would buy some again if the need arose.,"Because I live in a rather exposed location, I needed something to help secure water collecting barrels on a couple of garden buildings. Although these are intended for indoor use, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of their coating. Despite that I added a coat of Hammerite paint to ensure its durability. Although not what they are designed for, they continue to securely hold the barrels in position despite having to endure some really severe winds and look as good as they did when I installed them.",These brackets are very good for the price. I found them good and sturdy and would be able to support a reasonable load. Good value for money.,"Utilitarian these are, but fancy brackets  cost a lot. They are plenty strong enough for hifi equipment etc. I spray mine up with a primer and copper paint. Looks pretty good.",Well worth the money and does the job required just as well as more expensive ones. Highly recommended and will buy more as and when required.,A perfect set of brackets for making a shelf where diagonal cross bars would interfere.,the harbour grey shelf brackets were returned owing to me ordering the wrong size,"3 stars for sturdy quality. I expected this simply you get  what u paid for. However I only used 3 brackets for a 5 ft scalfoding broad.. I do not or will use it to put heavy weight unless using all 4 brackets Nevertheless good buy for what I intended for light to medium support. 4 stars for price, speedy delivery."

B004KYOGDO,Genuine Piranha Computer Desk with Filing Drawer and Cupboard Home Office PC2w,"Furniture,Home Office Furniture,Desks & Workstations,Computer Workstations",4.5,169.99,114.95,32,True,63,"This is a great value piece.  Yes ok, its not real wood but all pieces are well made considering the price point.Robustness - This is sturdy providing your not moving it around to much.  The back panel that joins the left and right upright sections is very small and only held in place by 4 'small' metal cam dowels.  The desk surface is also connected at the back by 4 metal cam dowels, and 3 lots of 4 'short' screws at each of the front metal pillars.  These are sufficient to hold the desktop in place but I wouldn't want to try and lift the whole desk by its top!  I wouldn't want to have to carry it far or put it under any unusual lateral stresses that a desk isn't normally designed to take.Colour - Though this is Walnut - it's different from Walnut varnish sold by Homebase and the Walnut furniture sold by B&Q.  My daughter now has 3 shades of walnut in her room!Computer Enclosure - The enclosure is quite tall but not very deep and even though there are large access holes in both of the left and right cupboard sections (with nicely moulded edges), my daughters PC did not go back far enough to allow the door to be fitted.  This isn't a major problem as the piece still looks cool without it.Instructions - Instructions are clear and easy to understand.  It took me about 2 and a half hours to build, mostly on my own. Having a 2nd person available would make some parts easier.Packaging - The desk comes in 2 boxes both of which are well lined with polystyrene - The packaging is some of the best I have seen .... BUT, despite this the back right hand corner of the desktop was slightly damaged.  I couldn't be bothered to take this any further as the affected area is out of sight.Read more ›","Ordered on Wednesday Midday and delivered early Friday AM so no problems with the order turnaround.  In Fact it was a lot quicker than expected.The Desk took just over 3 hours to assemble and seems very stable and solid once done.  All parts are clearly labelled making assembly that bit easier.It appears that the wood effect cover has been placed onto the parts after the needed holes etc. have been drilled, meaning things aren't clear on some parts as to where the screws should go at first.Although very well packaged there were a few scratches on some of the panels that are in mainly unseen places once built.  Because of where they are it's not worth the hassle making a complaint.  Another review highlighted this same issue so it looks like a common issue.The supplied screwdriver is not worth considering using.  It's too small to be effective.  Ensure you have a selection of Phillips screwdrivers.  I used a Torque screwdriver with different heads and used about 3 in total.For the Money this seems to be a very good desk, let down slightly with some niggle's on assembly, but once built you will likely be happy with the finished item.Although I assembled this myself it would have been helpful to have someone else to hand to assist at times, It may have helped reduce total build time.","This is the second desk I've had from this company the first being a computer desk which I was very impressed with. Unfortunately this one although being of good quality I had several pieces where the veneer was peeling off luckily it was on the back of the desk, but obviously I was a bit cheesed off with it, it is too big an item to send back for replacement so I have had to put up with it. Obviously these things happen I can only assume that they haven't got a very good quality control set up if any, so I won't be using them again hence the 3 stars.","Took me 3 hours to put this thing together on my own, but instructions are clear and all the bits are rugged - this won't start to wobble. Everything is solid and drawers slide smoothly.  What the picture doesn't show is that there are large holes in the back of both side units (for PC cooling / cables presumably) but the back is finished exactly the same as everywhere else so it still looks good even if you don't have it against a wall.","The desk took quite a while to build (2 of us working for over 4 hours), and there was quite bit of head-scratching at times, but the end result was a great-looking sturdy desk.","The Desk arrived intact, not difficult to put together. easy instructions, sturdy and hard wearing, just what I wanted. Good quality.","Not sure why but it's actually taken me nearly a year to buy my office desk due to working away from home and size issues. This is probably my best purchase of the year, more than pleased with this.  The product arrived within 3 days, being the novice I am with DIY I was quite impressed with all the parts being numbered however it took me about nearly 6 hours to put together but he end result is 'Superb'.  It looks 'Great'and the rounded edges helps if you have small children etc. All in all very happy customer and would recommend this item, absolute bargain at £98.95.","Great product and quite sturdy but be prepared to spend 5-6 hrs assembling this desk. I've assembled so many big and small IKEA products in the past but assembling this desk was no less than a nightmare. Reminds me of a quote by Einstein ""Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex... It takes a touch of genius - and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction""  Piranha needs some geniuses!! Nonetheless, awesome product once you are done putting it together."

It is of good quality and supports the weight of four towels without any sag.  However;  I was disappointed in that the specification was for an arm length of 39.1, the item received although of the correct product code, had an arm length of only 34cm.  While of good quality and we have been able to make use of it:  It is not to the specification expected or desired to support the width of folded bath towels.",Arrived within the expected time.  Easy to fit and an excellent product. Would use supplier again.,I've used it for a deep built in wardrobe as a trouser hanger . It makes the most of the dead space the rail could do with being space further apart to allow more clearance I'd imagine with towels it would start to push outward. I think I'll by a second one and double up the rails,A very high quality product and good value for money.  I have fitted this in my airing cupboard and have put four heavy bath sheets on it with no problems at all.I would not hesitate to recommend this fitting.,this item is exactly what i was looking for i have just had a new kitchen fitted and i have nowhere to put teatowel ovengloves etc so it was just the right size for the space i had left in my kithcen,Very pleased with this towel rail which is perfect for my compact kitchen.

The actual unit is well designed with excellent instructions, resulting in an ideal corner unit, well fit for purpose.","I found there was considerable choice when it came to computer desks. I chose this one both for the price and the appearance having decided on a corner unit. It was - without doubt - the right choice!It is heavy - so you will need two people to move it -but I was able to assembly on my own. That assembly was easy and quick. Whatever quality of self assembly I have bought one or more alignment of screw and hole, nut and bolt, angle and fitting has caused difficulty. I had NO SUCH DIFFICULTY with any part or fitting of this desk. Everything fits very well and the appearance is superb.As far as functionality is concerned there is more than enough desk top and shelves to accommodate your computer and all it's accessories. I do NOT have a tower but am sure one could more than adequately be housed.I have NO hesitation in recommending this well constructed, well finished and superb looking desk.I had to contact the seller - nothing to do with the quality or missing parts or service - and they were SUPERB in their customer service. Buy this quality excellent value and totally functional product with confidence.","Amazing product, my room had never looked better!cheap to buy, not too hard too build but requires 2 people to help build it.Fast delivery which has impressed me a lot because I had ordered this item 2 days ago and after 2 days it arrived Safe and well packaged.Truly Impressed!!",IT ARRIVED AFTER 3 DAYS ITS GOT CLEAR INSTRUCKTIONS SO ITS EASY TO PUT UP ON YOUR OWN. AND HAD A BAG OF SPARE FIXINGS. REALY NICE AND STRONG. NICE HARDWAREING FINISH.,"One of the best flat-pack desks I've ever bought.I bought it to replace a more expensive all-wood (MDF?) desk, which was a very basic, square design, with weak joints and was also ridiculously difficult to assemble. I eventually lost patience and scrapped it.This, however, is a very well-designed combination of MDF and metal - very sturdy once assembled. I have noticed a slight wobble when I'm typing (a little more pronounced in the keyboard shelf) but then I do type quickly and fairly forcefully.It was mostly quick and painless to assemble. The parts are well made and the instructions are clear. The only minor niggle I had was with the upper shelves, which have screw-type fittings at the corners and the back, where they attach to the back board and upper support poles.Initially, I could not get the bolts to screw into these and ended up requesting 2 lots of replacement parts from Piranha (who incidentally sent them out very quickly and with no fuss), before I realised they could be moved until they were positioned correctly to accept the bolts. However, this does require some fiddling around. I used a small, thin electronics screwdriver, inserting it into the holes and waggling it around until the holes in the fitting were aligned with the outer holes in the shelf.Quite frustrating for a while, but I now have a fully assembled desk, which can hold a surprising amount of gear, given its compact dimensions (PC tower, keyboard, 2.1 speaker set, 24"" widescreen monitor, printer and router, plus a few other bits and pieces).Once you get over any problems caused by the fittings, its fairly quick and easy to assemble, robust and should hold everything you need. Well worth the money.",this is a good quality item is easy to asemble took about half an hour and really looks the part our 21 year old loves it,"This is a very good corner unit ideal for what i wanted with very simple instructions, the delivery was quick and it was well packaged. However there was a small chip in one of the panels but nothing much and i didn't think the unit seemed very strong it seems to move/shake quite easily but this is a minor thing as the overall product is great and im very pleased with it.","The delivery was super fast and the unit was much better than I anticipated.

They have refunded me.,Look good in my new kitchen. Cheaper than a lot we looked at too. Would recommend to anyone wanting stylish stools,Poor packaging caused a mark across the back of one of the chairs where the faux leather padding has been crushed against another section of the stool. The seller may well have been happy to accept it back and send another but I don't have time so am prepared to live with it but it's just frustrating to not receive the goods in perfect condition. The stools themselves look ok and work perfectly. At full height though they are rather wobbly so I would not recommend if you are looking for something robust. Overall though they are very good value for money at £25 just don't expect great quality.

However, with the small dimensions required this was proving rather difficult.  This was the closest we could find and thought we will live with the extra 3"" depth and was pretty much sold by the reviews.  The desk arrived well packaged and on the date specified - another excellent Amazon delivery!  We did however recruit our DIY friend to put it together and set him the 5hr challenge.  Two rounds of tea and 2 hrs later it was done! We did not assemble the raised desk printer platform but instead used the wood to create an extra side shelf against the wall for the printer creating more desk space - nifty idea!  Overall really thrilled with the finished product which looks good, very solid and houses all our IT equipment neatly at a reasonable price.  We also bought a leather chair and a lamp and the overall look is fantastic creating a property study for both work and leisure.  I would thoroughly recommend this product.",Very heavy piece of equipment and took me a long time to put it together but was so happy once it was finished. It's a gorgeous looking item of furniture and mega sturdy. My son is over the moon with it.,"I bought this desk after reading very good reviews from other customers, and I was not disappointed.All the pieces were clearly labelled, the instructions were so easy to follow it was almost idiot proof. Though I didn't have the time to put it together in one go, when I finally finished I realised it probably had not taken me longer than two hours to do it. I found doing it almost therapeutic.The desk seems really solid, but there is one thing I have noticed since putting it together, the door of the bottom drawer came apart when I was opening it, but after redajusting the bolts on the inside it seems to be ok, I hope that is the case. Does this company make kitchen cabinets with the same quality? I have already recommended the company to friends and colleagues so impressed was I with the quick delivery, the easy to follow instructions and what appears to a good quality product.",Delivery was very fast right on the money so thats good.Now comes the most important bit biulding it. I might have just been because I have never done this DIY stuff before (I'm only 18) but it took me about 5 hours to biuld the whole thing from scratch which I have no idea but it seems quite a long time. But overall I'm very pleased with the product and the service provided so I would recommend this to anyone.Tips-Use ur own screw driver from screwing in the bolts I found that the one provided did no give me enough purchase in the grooves of the screws/bolts however keep it for the bits where it gets too small for a normal sized screwdriver to fit in.- If you are having trouble with the bolts that 'hook' onto the parts A/L try this - use ur screwdriver or the one provided to push the bolt out of its hole then postion it back it so the area with the space in the middle(hope that makes sense) is facing the hole do for all the bolts you need and then place the section in and screw all of the bolts clockwise you should see it go tighter.- Don't use too much force in the screwing action as I found out to my cost by doing that you will wear away the grooves at a very fast rate!- Keep a hammer by your side (Yes Jeremy Clackson is right everything can be mended by a hammer =D) I found sometimes when screwing in a bolt it can go wonky to rectify this just nudge/hit the offending side slightly to aling back in a more pleasing postion.Hope this helps anyone who is looking to buy this awesome product!,"The product itself arrived in good condition with the packing secure and all parts easily identified. However,the problem was with the assembly. It was immediately obvious that the assembly would be well beyond the collective capabilities of my wife and me.We ended up  engaging a professional to do the job for us. It took him two hours at a cost of over £60. This took the edge off our pleasure at receiving such a good product","I was so pleased with this desk, it arrived within 3 days of the order, packed really well , every piece was numbered and there was even a small pack of spare pieces of screws etc plus a small screwdriver.  Very clear instructions although at first it looked complicated , we realised how good they were as we started to assemble the desk , it did take two as the panels are quite heavy to hold alone.  We used a drill driver to put in some of the connectors , everything fitted well and slotted fairly easily into its place.The desk is very sturdy and has a nice wood effect pattern, the drawers were smaller than I imagined but are quite deep enough to hold extra paper and stationery items.I would recommend this desk for anyone who wants a sturdy , nice looking piece of furniture, it fits fine into our spare bedroom for the computer and will also double as a dressing table if we have guests.",

It's very soft and may not stand up well to things like buckles and zips (I'm not about to test it!) but the stools are certainly easy to assemble (four bolts using the supplied Allen key) and very comfortable. At the price, I'd have no hesitation in recommending them. The trader I used, great-deal-forever, got them to me next working day.ONE TIP: The gas struts come with little black caps, presumably to stop the struts being activated in transit. The instructions don't tell you to remove them but I'm pretty sure you should do!UPDATE 8Feb15: It may be helpful to know that, 13 months on, we're still happy with these. I was right in thinking the faux-leather wouldn't withstand scratches very well, so they're not ideal if you have animals that might scratch them, but we've been careful with ours and they're fine, with just one little scuff. They're £2 cheaper than when we bought them, and I'm about to order two more.","I bought these to replace two of my previous stools. They look the same and are definitely value for money, however when they arrived I could see straight away that they were smaller, and unless you are quite slim you may find them a tight fit. Also whatever weight you are you seem unsteady on them as though your about to slip to the floor owing to the shortness in depth from back to front. I looked around before ordering only to find that similar stools were of almost identical measurements. Perhaps all the manufacturers have reduced their sizes as I remember complaints from people who didn't have enough space in their kitchen to put the larger chairs.","Very happyThe stools turned up seperatly packaged well. They are great quality for the price I paid. I saw the exact same ones in a large chain shop which cost the same for just one.One of the stools was faulty and the hydrolics didn't seem to work (it sunk a little to much when you sat on it). The customer service we received was great they tried to help us solve the problem ourselves, when it was apparent we could not fix it they said they would replace the base. We received it within days. Problem solved.","Great, easy to put together, although when box arrived, it was split down one side and we worried that something was missing but we were lucky.  Love them, reasonably priced and serve their purpose, easy to wipe down and comfortable.","Excellent product, excellent service and excellent price. The stools were easy to put together and are of a very good quality. These stylish stools are very comfortable to sit in (I had tried so many bar stools before making this purchase )",We get so many compliments on these chair. They are really good value for the money and can be used as extra dining chairs when entertaining as they can be any height.,They look large but dont use too much space. They look high but you can regulate the hight. They give life to any kitchen. They are great.,Bought these in Oct 2013 and they have now fallen apart with what I would call very average use by very average sized people. Backs on 3 of of the 6 have now broken and unusable. In addition the small hydraulic unit that let's you move the seats up and down has also given up on 2 of the units so when you sit on them you gradually sink down.I have noticed that the bottom of the units that contains the hydraulic unit is common on many brands of similar designed chairs on Amazon so beware!!!!!I am now looking for 6 more chairs but with fixed structures to avoid such problems with the hydraulics.ALL IN ALL I WOULD NOT BUY

They arrived very promptly and seem to be good quality, although they haven't been used yet.",bought this for 7 year old- just the right size - easy to handle - just a smaller version of full size cutlery,"Very good quality, Feels good in the hand and look good also my grandchild likes them.

I picked this particular set as firstly it's a six place setting and secondly it's nice and simple, clean lines and is forged all from one piece of steel so it should last forever.All in all a lovely set and it would make a lovely gift for a young couple setting up home, at a very reasonable price.","It was the simplicity of this design that drew my attention to it, exactly what I was looking for. Nothing simple about the quality though, Very well made, solid one piece stainless steel. Excellent value for money. Delighted with the purchase.","I needed some new cuttlery and as I have an Andrew James Halogen oven I thought the quality should be excellent and I wasn't disappointed. Lovely, weighty, simple and stylish.","After 30-odd years it was time to re-stock the cutlery drawer with pieces that actually matched, that I wouldn't be ashamed to put out for guests.I didn't want to spend too much on anything fancy: this looked like a classy, sleek, plain design, and at this price I thought I'd take a chance. I'm glad I did - you'd never guess I'd spent under £12 for six complete place settings, all the pieces are a good weight and come up looking shiny and new after every dishwasher cycle. A really good buy.",Very good quality for the price.,"Excellent set to replace all my mismatched cutlery built up through the years.  It's highly polished and a good weight, with no sharp or jagged edges anywhere.  I highly recommend this.With my original order I received only one of the correct forks, and five with a different design.  They sent me the five correct forks within a couple of days, and I even got to keep the other five forks.  Highly recommended seller as well.",Very nice very shiny and Andrew James ingraved in to the back of the cutlery,"Excellent quality set for the price. Normally you would expect the fork teeth to be different sizes and bent, but these were all perfectly formed and machined. Highly polished, good weight, and very solid.

Adjustable height perfect, quality, perfect.  wpuld recommend to anyone.  Real value for money.",My wife got this for me at Christmas so I've now been using it for a couple of months. It was easy to put together simple instructions and all the parts were with it. Compared to the other modelling desks that are available which are made of steel I would say this one is outstanding for the price and overall usability it's easy to adjust hight so it's comfortable for you and there's plenty of surface space to use and I would highly recommend this product,"A great idea and ideal for my 'man shed' which I use for an office during the week and to do art projects with my granddaughter when she visits.  We can work alongside each other and because it is adjustable we can both work in comfort.  When I need it for work it is easily laid flat and my laptop and papers fit nicely and the height set to my needs.  It has a smaller footprint than my traditional desk which it is replacing and therefore gives me more space in a limited area.  The single draw will hold the essential stationary items but draws will be needed for anything more.Sadly the first desk I received was damaged.  The top was split lengthways and needed to be returned (£30 postage and Amazon refunded £3.30).  A replacement was sent out immediately and that was in good order.It was easy enough to assemble but the instructions could do with some improvement and clarification.  Having said that, any decent DIY person should have no problems. It has a good feel to it as it is wood rather than MDF and that was the main attraction for me.","A nice desk which looks good in my sons room.The construction of the desk was a different matter, however. Some of the screws didn't fit properly into the cross members which I had to then drill out. If I'd forced the screws in I would have ruined the desk. Oh and the desk top is slightly ""wavy"" due to the bits of wood which make up the top being slightly different thickness's. However, as a test I used a ruler to draw a line on a single piece of paper. The line came out straight so I don't regard the wavy nature of the top as a problem.So recommended apart from the caveat about putting it together and the slightly wavy top. Oh yes, the desk has become a lot more expensive since I bought it, so I don't think it is now particularly great value.","Delivered to Cyprus in just 2 days - amazing! Assembling without any problems. Overall quality is good.Even in lower position this table appeared to be too high for my 7 yo son, so I had to saw 4 details to lower it down by 5cm.","The desk is great now it's up but as mentioned in other reviews it arrives in many, many pieces. I took about 3 hours to assemble it. The instructions are clear though.","Good size, ideal for my creative 5 year old daughter and doubles up for homework. Good value for money. Recommend highly","Brought for my wife as a present, much better than another one she had seen in a retail store."

But, the compartments in this item are disappointingly and unnecessarily, small and shallow. They look more like trinket compartments. If your bra size is bigger than AA cup and under wired, don't expect it to fit. Likewise if you own big, sturdy knickers or have thick sock balls which you want to store. And yes, they are flimsy: the dividers are not rigid or even semi-rigid, but soft thin fabric that is not stitched to the base of the 'tray'...so things can potentially slip out from under the dividers and end up in neighbouring compartments. So much for organisation.","Great product-at 1st I thought the 3 differing layouts would be a problem, but they worked out fine-one for trainer-type socks, one for sports socks & one for thick walking boot socks. Does what it says on the tin!!","I love these organisers and I'm about to purchase a second set! They are small however my drawers are quite small therefore they fitted perfectly! Using them for socks, bras and scarfs","I bought 5 packs of this product without trying at first and am absolutely satisfied. stores everything - from both men and women underwear, to gloves, swimm suits, socks, stockings, sport tops, etc. Can also put them on each other - it is very easy to take out and get something from the one on the bottom. Very good quality for the price.","Wonderful, tidy drawers and cupboards in our motorhome. Well made and super priced and promptly delivered","After getting stressed at the start of my underwear draw (the struggle is real) I decided to purchase this set. Really glad I did, does exactly as described, fits in my draw perfectly and just zips together.I will say that the organiser for bras was far too small, but I just used it for socks instead - perfect!","Whilst I think these are a brilliant idea (and they really are) and I am impressed by how well they do the job; the only downside is the price. They aren't exactly quality. Time will tell how long they last, however, they will get you organised superbly."

Great concept - would ask the manufacturer to use a sturdier material in the future.  (I have others which are alot stronger and hold heavier items with ease).,"This is a great storage solution to use in your kitchen as it has a good capacity and fits well in a normal shelf (mine is 1,5cm and fits very well, I've measure it and it will fit shelves until 2,5cm).

Slightly hard to see through, as not clear as in the picture, but cloudy, opaque plastic. Given all I wanted was something to replace cling film to cover baby food being warmed up, these work perfectly.  They kinda do what you expect.  Could be a bit deeper so food doesn't hit the top if piled on a plate.  Overall, I am happy with the purchase.",Good selection of sizes. Also handy for covering dishes when eating outside. Use them indoors when having buffet style meal as keep food fresher..,"Only 4 stars because the first parcel that arrived for me was something completely different.

The covers were as I expected, so am very pleased with them.","I was really surprised when these arrived.  They are a lot smaller than I thought they were going to be, but as I already have large ones they suit my needs.  The vent hole of the smallest one cannot be closed as it has no cap.  The others do, but even they do not cover the holes completely, there is still a little gap.

It is brilliant!I have just had carpel tunnel syndrome surgery on both hands, and need to find gadgets to help me do basic jobs like chopping onions. I have a Kitchen Aid machine with all the attachments, but needed something I could just grab to do a quick job. I had discounted all sorts of tools as they would aggravate my hands and wrists, and out of desperation I ordered this.Wow! So simple.  All you do is peel and cut a big onion into 4, and stick it in the bowl of this tool on top of the blades; then pop the lid on and pull the handle.......easy! An onion takes 4 or 5 pulls. I was so shocked it worked so well that I timed it. It takes 10 seconds, tops! I couldn't even get the cover off if the Kitchen Aid in that time! It rinses out easily, and goes in the dishwasher too.......but I'm worried about it crazing the plastic over time, the way some things do,  so I just rinse it quickly and it's done. Perfect. You must try it!:-) I keep mine on the work top now.","this is an unusual veg chopper,quite different in design to the push down type(which have a tendency to snap after a while).this uses a pull cord mechanism which spins the sharp blades.you can decide how chopped you wish the vegetables to be by the amount of times you pull the cord.easy to clean and takes up very little room in the kitchen.",It was a bit smaller than expected but chops onions/garlic etc as fine as you would wish.It's brilliant for onions as no tears and chops really quickly i just quarter them pop them in the Rotomac and after 2-3 pulls job done and really quick.if you use cling film over the top when chopping herbs etc for a sauce it saves on cleaning as you cannot submerge the top in water for cleaning,"Delivered within the given time. Excellent for chopping herbs in seconds, onions, vegetables etc... Actually it does everything it says it can do. Cheaper and bigger than its competition. Worth every penny. Thank you.",Best manual chopper ever!The bowl is big enough and the blades are very sharp.The base of the bowl is sturdy and anti-slippery.,"Would recomend this metalex chopper,choose how big or small you chop your veg by the amount of times you pull the cord,good size bowl and such a low price compared to others ,excellent service ordered Friday afternoon arrived Monday tea time, also very sturdy does not jump about on the worktop.EXCELLENT,LOVE IT.","Arrived in good time and in good condition.  I liked it, it was easy to use but I didn't realise it was quite so small.  This did make it easy to store but you could only do a bit at a time.  However it did what it said and you could choose how big or small you wanted things chopped. I would recommend it.","Do yourself a favour and watch the video on here regarding the Zyliss Easy Pull Manual Chopper. The Metaltex Rotomac appears to be a smaller version. This is a very effective manual food chopper but you need to be aware of several things. The measurements on Amazon UK are totally inaccurate: Measuring 11.5cm height by 12.5cm diameter and weighing 344grams, the Metaltex Rotomac can only handle liquids such as water up to 400ml without the rest of it leaking out the lid when it has been added to the bowl. There are no measure gradients on the bowl other than vertical lines in the plastic which have been added for structure/durability and they do not provide a suitable measurement - try it with liquids over the top of the line and when the blade is activated the liquid will start to flood out the sides.I already own an electric Tefal Food Express for shredding and slicing but it doesn't chop, hence my purchase.With this award winning contraption, the Metaltex Rotomac ""Herb and Vegetable"" chopper is aptly named. It performs better as a chopper than anything else I have tried despite the claim that it can be used for milkshakes.It just about chops an onion. Two if you are lucky to have small ones to hand. Two to four average carrots chopped in half will fill this bowl completely. It chops so quickly that it takes me no time at all to prep all vegetables for either a stew, casserole or even home made soup. It is great for those who have no time for chopping manually. But...This hand sized mini chopper cum-manual food processor isn’t all that well thought out in my experience. The lid can't be immersed in water but rather can only really be cleaned with a damp cloth. Quality PVC plastics to the touch but to a point.Read more ›"

B003R7QNDQ,Black Maxi Poster Frame - 61cm x 91.5cm,"Artwork,Posters",4.5,19.99,17.81,11,True,809,"Bought this item for a poster we wanted to hang, picture indicates the frame is curved, but it's actually flat.... which I didn't actually mind cause it matches everything else we have - but thought it should be mentioned in case anyone looking at it actually wants a curved frame.Also the 'glass' is some type of sheet plastic.... but its super shiny and lightweight and you would never know looking at it that it isn't actually glass. It comes protected on both sides by film, so no scratches in transit!I had a bit of trouble getting the back back on, it has the little bendy bits of metal like you have on smaller photo frames, but my poster fits perfectly and once it was back on it held strong. Also, the back has two hooks, so it can be hung portrait or landscape.So overall pretty happy with it and so glad I didn't pay more for something more expensive!!","On either side of the see-through screen is a piece of sticky plastic.  You need to remove this before adding your poster.  If you fail to do this the screen will look scratched, with dents and marks (in other words, pretty much useless.) I think some people have forgotten to do this, which is why the screen on the poster frame looks terrible.  I put it together with the plastic on (first time) and it looked awful.  Now, the screen is crystal clear and for the price it's a total bargain.  The frames look like they cost much more when they're hanging on the wall.  Black wooden frames with a nice finish.  Don't let the negative reviews put you off.","If you are using this frame in portrait mode it's OK. However, in landscape mode there is an issue - the weight of the plastic glass and frame is too great for the overall frame at the hanging point - and the top of the frame bows - distorting the frame. This is not what you expect!","I bought a poster from HMV and needed a frame for it. This was the perfect fit, I didn't need to cut/fold the poster before putting it in the frame and it didn't leave a gap between the poster and the frame either, amazing! Its a black wood material which is nice since I didn't want a plastic one. Its been 2 months since I got it and I don't regret it one bit.",Great frame for the money seems a little wobbly when putting the poster and frame together but once its on the wall looks the part cant say more.,"A large picture frame that fits posters in it.  Arrived quickly. Corners had protectors on to prevent them being bashed in transit.  Getting the film off was easy, but it did leave static, so try not to do this near a dusty surface!",Very pleased with this frame.  Fitted my poster perfectly and arrived on time.  I also like the lightness in weight. Would recommend this sellar and the product.,"This arrived promptly and in robust packaging. It was easy to loosen the clips and slide the poster inside though we took two attempts as hanging points are along only two sides and who wants an upside down poster on their wall, not my son. Overall this was excellent value."

It's just long enough to fit all of my loose knives (5 small- and medium-sized ones, 1 large bread knife and 1 large chef's knife), but I wouldn't recommend it for more than about 4-5 large knives or 7-8 small ones. The grip is strong (it can almost hold itself up on a magnetic surface without being attached!), but not so strong that it's hard to remove the knives when you need them. It doesn't look beautiful or decorative, but it's a functional piece of kitchen equipment.The knife bar comes with fittings to screw it into a wall or door, but I didn't want to put holes in my kitchen wall, so I attached it with 3M command strips. So far, so good (but if you do as I did, make sure you are using the strongest ones!).",I was concerned that maybe the magnets would not be strong enough to hold all the knives.  No concerns there!,Arrived promptly and was so easy to put on the wall. Looks very professional and my knives are now proudly sitting on the rack instead of being stuffed in a unhygienic wooden block. Great product thoughly recommend it,"Bought it half a year ago, followed advice I read somewhere about attaching it with commando strips to avoid having to use screws.

Then i saw this one and couldnt believe the price! i was a little worried that other reviews said it wasnt reversible and the white side (the side i was to use) was rubbery. I thought i would give it a try for the price anyway. I was expecting something similar to the ikea blackout blind kind of feel, that thick rigid feel. But when it arrived earlier then estimated (always nice) i was very happy with the quality and feel. You can use either side and isnt rubbery at all. I would say it is the same quality you would expect from large home stores for a fraction of the price. i will use again to make curtains for my daughters room.",I use it to black out my bedroom windows which it does perfectly. I folded it over and sewed some velcro like tape onto it.  It was a bit tough for the sewing machine but it managed it.,Excellent product.  Exceeded expectations,"This fabric is excellent! Bought to make a blind/cover for my velux window.I work shifts and the sun beaming through the white blind already installed was horrific when trying to sleep. It would have cost £90 to replace my existing white blind with a blackout blind however on my days off I actually like the brightness of the white blind so was left with a bit of a dilemma...until I found this fabric!I bought a metre. measured my window, cut to size and attached with some heavy duty Velcro coins. Job done! The fabric is quite plush on one side and more flat and rigid on the reverse and it cut cleanly so no need to hem. Plus the Velcro coins stuck to the flat side no issues at all and are holding up brilliantly after two weeks. Now I can block out the sun when I need to sleep and rip the cover down when I want my room nice and bright, I am so pleased.This fabric truly is 100% blackout, best £3 I've ever spent! Will be buying more to make some curtains for my other bedroom window.","Size ordered fitted my curtains exactly.Really easy to fit, I thought I would use 'wonder web' instead of sewing just for ease, worked really well.Would definitely order again.","brilliant my daughter gets a lie now cos it stays dark longer in her bedroom , so get a lie into cos she don't wake me at the crack of dawn! all good.",Does exactly what it says on the tin.

This throw is plenty long enough and allows for tucking in around the arm and seat cushions so you don't get those ""tight"" areas when you sit down. The cloth is good quality cotton and soft to the touch, and the matching cushion covers are well made and round off the look when mixed with your own cushions.A great buy for protecting your new sofa or for making an old one look good again.","I bought two of these extra-large throws to cover two shabby old 3-seater sofas which had seen better days.  They are easily big enough to do this and the free matching cushion covers were a nice bonus.  Perhaps they're not the thickest or most durable fabric, so with a husband and two brawny sons in th house I'm not sure how long they'll last without wearing into holes, but they were reasonably-priced and have washed well (on a warm wash programme) without noticeable shrinkage or colour fading.  All in all, I'm pleased with my purchase!!",This item is much better than I expected for the price I have now bought two more and a couple of friends have asked for the link as they are better quality than some high street brands that cost 3 times as much.

He's never fallen out of bed with this under the sheet. It's easy to put in under the sheet, and didn't seem to bother him at all while it was in the bed.Removed it after 2/3 months, and it seems to have done the trick in training him to sleep more centrally in the bed. There have been 1 or 2 falls since removing it (though thankfully onto the mattress we placed there in expectation!), but that's over the course of 6 months, so it's clearly been a big help. Highly recommended.Highly recommended.",this is just what i was looking for.  the standard bedrails did not fit my mamas and papas cot bed for my little boy. this is a great item that does the trick as it's soft and secure and gives you piece of mind when you put your little one to bed,This works perfectly.  It keeps my youngest grandson safe when he is staying and also I use it as a bed divider when my two elder grandchildren come.  Just place it under the sheet and it stays put.  Brilliant.,Very firm.

Once the mattress was in the bag it was easy to handle and very strong.,Ordered this as was same price as a roll of polythene from B&Q. Came quickly and fitted super king size mattress with room to spare. Well worth it.,"Bought this to transport a king size mattress and was disappointed that the bag only just covered the mattress.  Would have made it a lot easier if they had provided at least another foot of plastic so it could be folded under at the end to protect the end of the mattress.  For the price of this ""plastic bag"" it needed the extra length for me to be happy with it - and I assume it would have only cost the manufacturers pennies to give that little bit extra.","I have recently bought a kingside and super kingsize version of this bag from this seller. We have a deep double and deep kingsize mattress so decided to go,a size up to accommodate for the depth. However, we were very disappointed to find that they were not big enough. We resorted to using both of them (one on either end) to protect our double mattress and had to tape around to hold them in place. the plastic looks reasonably tough but the sizing is way off.","I love that giving this five stars means ""I LOVE IT!"" yes.. I love a plastic bag.These were bought for the purpose of packing away a dismantled folding treadmill, and I have every confidence they will do so without tearing, leaking, or allowing outside particles in.",Very impressed with this - fitted our super-king mattress with extended topper and lasted through moving two mattresses despite being manhandled in and out of lifts and across many different surfaces. Just the right thickness to be durable without adding extra bulk itself.,"I bought this for moving my Superking sized mattress in June 2013.  It has now been removed after almost 18 months and my mattress is absolutely fine. I have limited movement in my arms and hand grip,  I am probably teaching my grandmother to suck eggs here but I found the bag easy to pull onto the mattress, just concertina it down and concentrate on getting 2 of the furthest corners in and then work each side along the mattress a bit at a time.I found the bag to have a good and hard wearing thickness for keeping the mattress  clean, dry and in good shape. It is a silent night one that has springs and is topped with memory foam, the depth of it is 10 inches, (25.5cms)I fastened the end of it with 3 inch sticky, silver tape. (Can't remember what it's called)",Really thick heavy duty plastic. Did not rip nor did it feel like it might rip. Really impressed our removals guys who wanted to know where we got them from.

B013BUI502,August LEC350 - Dimmable LED Desk Lamp with USB Phone Charger - Office Work Light with 3 Lighting Modes / Adjustable Brightness / 30 mins Auto Timer / 5V 1.5A Charging Port,"Indoor Lighting,Lamps,Desk Lamps",5,34.95,24.95,29,True,46,"You might be forgiven for dismissing some of the previous reviews as 'sponsored' i.e. the lamp appears to have been provided free to some lucky customers in exchange for a review. This review is completely independent and unbiased:An excellent lamp, a beautiful piece of design, executed in quality materials (metal superstructure, plastic base).I bought two for each of my son's desks to cure a shadow cast by the ceiling lamp behind them. This light is infinitely variable in terms of tone and brightness and exactly what we wanted. My only gripe is that the base could be weighted - if you cant the lamp to the extreme of its range then base will topple over. That is a minor gripe, but perhaps a 'mod' for the future.I cannot yet testify to the lamp's reliability or longevity but expect that like most things electrical, if it doesn't pack up in five minutes due to a component failure it will last for years. I've seen no feedback elsewhere to suggest this might happen. If you saw this lamp in a interior design shop you would not have trouble paying a ticket price double that asked, based upon impressions of design and quality. Well done Daffodil in sourcing this lamp and retailing it.",I was lucky enough to get my hands on one of these to test /review.Pro's- 30min Sleep timer great little feature for if you like me have a habit of falling asleep whilst at your desk- usb charging socket not really much I can describe about this it supplies enough power to charge my z3 and just functions as intended- Great design and adjustable height and direction- Built in dimmer ranges from dim light to floodlight and everything in between great for lighting a whole room on its own- 3 light colours theres a natural light colour which is very close to traditional lamps (yellow tinge) a blue light which is like a standard led but closer to a xenon bulb & just plain old white led which is honestly my faviourate as it doubles up to make great lightning for photos.Con's- Gets a little warm at the top but I've never found a light that doesn't- Lacks a remote control but maybe I'm just asking too much for the price- Sleep timer could do with a range of settings ie 5mins-2hours also an auto off would be a great addition- No ability to replace bulbsAll in all I love this little lamp it arrived just in time to replace my old desk lamp which unfortunately kicked the bucket when the bulb blew though this may suffer the same fate in the future as the bulbs don't appear to be replaceable but at the price I'd just buy a new lampOverall 4.5/5Great functional design with a few minor flaws mostly personal preference and being overly demanding of lots of features to play with but granted I moan about this I'd still definately replace all my desk lamps with these.,"I've only just started using my lamp (arrived today), so can't comment about durability yet, but from a product design and functionality point of view, I am really impressed with it. It looks great and I really like the light temperatures it offers and the 5 levels of dimming. It looks and feels to be made of good quality materials and is well assembled.If I have one gripe (hence the one dropped star), and it's been mentioned by others, it needs a heavier base. I find I need to hold on to the base when moving the lamp angle at all. I suppose adding dead weight to the base is a costly thing to do as a manufacturer of exported goods as you're paying extra for your shipping. I wish I could think of an elegant way of adding the weight to it, but short of sticking it to the table top, I can't see a way. The lamp doesn't fall over as long as you don't lower the bottom arm beyond about 45 degrees, which you shouldn't normally need to do anyway.I bought mine on a lightning deal and just hope it comes up again soon, as I would definitely buy another. I bought it intending to use it as a bedside reading lamp, but now I've got it on my desk in the home office, I don't want to move it now, it looks so good and works so well.Unlike most of the other reviewers (which did make me worry as to the impartiality of them), I did not receive my lamp at a discounted price for a review (other than the fact I bought it in an Amazon Lightning Deal). So my review really is unbiased.","I have a similar light to this already but needed one for the other bedside table. It's a good economical light that comes pre-assembled (unlike my current one that I had to put together myself), so all you have to do is plug it in. The light has touch sensitive buttons that control on/off (holding down this button puts the light on a half hour timer after which it will turn off), light temperature (not literal temperature of course but whether it is a warm white colour or a brighter white colour) and also up and down brightness buttons.I really like the fact that the light has a USB port at the rear of the base which allows me to charge my Iphone 6 plus which also has a battery case on during the night. The 30 minute timer is a nice addition to the lamp and combined with dimming the light on a warm setting it can be relaxing to fall asleep to. Although I like that the base is heavy enough not to cause the light to wobble in any way it would have been nice to have an indented base to allow me to put spare change in. The light can swivel horizontally on it's base and vertically along the arm itself that allows a good range of movement and positioning. As the lights are LED, it means it uses less electricity and is more economical for long periods of use. All in all it's a great lamp although a fraction steeper than I would expect.",,,,

The power source is not bulky at all and both the lamp itself and the power cable do not get overly hot.There are 7 brightness levels which are adjusted by a touch pad on the lamp base, the lamp also remembers the last brightness setting you left it on so it will revert to that setting each time its turned back on.The lamp is actually quite bright, so its great as a desk lamp, and very useable as a bedside lamp to light up a room, to read a book or watch a movie.I recommend it, it is a great purchase, I thoroughly enjoy using it.I hope you find my insight useful.","Love this desk lamps. I actually bought two and we use them as bedside lamps and they make the room look awesome. They are very powerful, use them on the lowest setting otherwise we'll be blinded. The touch controls are nice and easy to use, and they have a red back-light which indicates the dimmer setting, and they show even when off which makes them easy to find at night when dark - see attached picture.",this light isn't bright enough to require a dimmer! also the lamp unit is only moveable bin the vertical - it does not tilt,"The build quality of the lamp is fine. However the hinge on the base is very loose. If you position the neck at around 30 to 60 degree or so, it just wont be able to hold.

After reading other reviews on Amazon I went with this lamp and I have to say that I agree that it is brilliant. It gives plenty of light to study evenings and it looks sleek, I have even had some compliments from friends. The only improvement I could think of is making the standard able to rotate in its base.",Totally agree with the praise heaped on the design and functionality.  But my lamp has stopped working after just one month -  very disappointing.
B00J5DZJJU,August LEC250 - 9W LED Desk Lamp - Office Work Light with Dimmer for Adjustable Brightness (Black),"Indoor Lighting,Lamps,Desk Lamps",4.5,45.25,17.75,61,True,246,"The Daffodil LEC250 is a great desk lamp that has an extremely intuitive and minimalistic, aesthetically pleasing design. The dimmer settings are fantastically simple and the bulb produces an adjustable solid white light which is ideal for various situations such as reading. It is also incredibly easy to setup out of the box, and produces little heat.However, a small pain point is the base of the lamp which due to it's lightness is not very sturdy; when adjusting the lamps arm to an upright position (eg. moving from a 45 degree angle to 90 degrees), it lifts the base up into the air meaning that you have to use one hand to hold it down in order to move the arm with the other hand. In addition, when the lamps arm is moved down to a 30 degree angle it will continue to fall on its own until the head of the lamp hits the surface it is sitting on, which can be irritating (not that most people will need the lamp to be this low, but it is a point to consider).Overall, the lamp is good value for money, produces clean light, and has an easy to use dimmer.","I bought this lamp after spending ages looking at more 'traditional' desk lamps and deciding that I didn't want something that was reviewed as being flimsy, cheap or gets too hot to touch. So I decided to go for this lamp as it looks fantastic design wise and is more energy efficient using LED bulbs.It arrived today and I have plugged it in and tried it out in both daylight and in a dark room. It is fantastic- the light can be dimmed to the level you want, but even on full it does not hurt your eyes. The light is bright and clear, like daylight, and illuminates my desk perfectly without giving any glare.The arm and the lamp part is adjustable so you can have it in different positions. There's no dangly switch to fiddle with, you turn it on/off simply using your finger on an area of the base which is touch sensitive, and it's the same for the dimmer which you slide your finger up and down a groove in the base for.No negatives at all, brilliant lamp.",Looks fantastic for the price. Really nice touch switch and dimmer controls.If you us Apple Mac equipment the lamp matches perfectly.,"Touch pad to change the brightness is a cheap touch pad. Due to this, mine kept fitting out and changing the brightness and turning off on its own. The product is also incredibly flimsy and doesn't retain its position when you move it (hinge is cheap). Overall this product feels and performs like a £5 lamp at a push. Definitely not worth a fraction of the amount of the asking price.","Gone are the days where you only had one choice of lamps-- those old lights where you had to stick your hand up the shade and turn this dried out, jagged, plastic knob to turn on and off the light.Nowadays, you have a choice of energy efficient lights that you can both control the intensity and what kind of light bulbs you'd like to use.Daffodil, a British company, has made a very creative and elegant looking desk lamp that allows you to turn on and off the light as well as adjust the intensity by just stroking a finger along the base of the lamp.It couldn't get any simpler than that.This lamp features 7 levels of brightness and has 21 bulbs installed in the head.  And, it weighs less than 3 lbs.The lamp took all of 2 minutes to unbox and plug into the wall.Excellent product.","Its novel, looks pretty cool, seems decently made and touch controls work well.I totally agree with the previous reviews that the hinge is just not robust enough as when you move the arm more than 30 degrees from the vertical, it slowly but surely just flops down.The top also hinges and I fail to see the point of that as if the main arm worked correctly the light wouldn't need to hinge at all.Personally, for me the light is just too white and glaring. Even on its lowest setting near the computer screen its very distracting whereas my old fashioned bulb lamp is fine.I sort of like it, but not loads. I think if you are wanting it for writing or other activities and dont want one of those horrible flexi arm things then it would be a good, and better looking replacement. If its for any sort of ambient lighting, forget it.","Brilliant product. The light in my apartment is not so bright so I needed a lamp which could provide enough light on my desk (I am preparing for exams so study mainly in the night). I read the reviews and ordered this lamp. I can say this is great! First of all the packaging was brilliant. You could see that this is like a good quality product. Then the lamp itself. Took like 30 secs to open and plug it. The best feature is that there is no button, and of course the light is satisfactory. All in all, a great product.","Desk lamp, simple design but high class and elegantThis is one of those products that is able to leave you with your mouth hanging open. Neither the picture nor the description is able to capture the true sense of this product that dazzles you as soon as you open the box.Simple though, the design is full of elegance. The lamp fits perfectly in any spot you wish to put it; from study table to an office desk as in my case.Not all the surprises end there. When I removed the lamp from the box I was looking for the power button…you cannot see it till you plug it in! It is a touch switch button in the base of the lamp. The adjustable brightness is no less surprising, its touch type too.Each day I am happier with this lampCongratulations for this product.B.R.Sebas"

These storage boxes are proving to be a great help in my daily fight against mess!As with other similar storage boxes these have cardboard sides within a fabric cover, and fold flat to allow for easy storage when not in use. Compared to others that I have had in the past these are nice and sturdy and will be able to withstand a good amount of day to day use, providing a child doesnt try to stand or sit on them.The animal images on these storage boxes are bold and bright so they are attractive to children and the animals are easy for them to recognise and identify. Each box has a different animal on it so would be a great way for children to keep their things together with each child having a box with their choice of animal on it. The neutral background colour, which is the same for the rest of the box, means they are unlikely to clash with any decor and would also be fairly discreet for storing some toys in the main family living room. The boxes are, of course, very light when they are empty so can be moved from room to room easily, and can also be put onto shelves, on top of a wardrobe and so forth to maximise storage space and keep things neat and tidy. They are 30cm cubed so big enough to hold a lot of things but small enough to tuck out of the way when necessary.Overall these are great little boxes with cheerful designs and provide a good amount of extra storage space, I highly recommend them.I received a discount on the price of these boxes in return for writing this honest and unbiased review.","This  set of four storage boxes from “MyPresentForYou” arrives neatly packaged and each box is individually wrapped in plastic in one of Amazon’s standard brown boxes. They are unexpectedly heavy and this suggests they are not flimsy or insubstantially made.Each box is made of a natural colour canvas material with a rigid framework. Imagine if a tent was cube shaped! You get four; one that has a orange monkey face print on one side, one with an grey owl print, one with a pink flamingo and one with a blue elephant face. The boxes are 30 cm by 30 cm by 30 cm giving for separate cubes in total.  I was lucky enough to get this at a discount for providing an honest review.  The usual Amazon price for this product is £26I’d imagine the storage boxes are intended for storage of children’s books or toys but if desired, you could place these so that the animal print facing towards the back so that they look like plain boxes. They would fit into the shelf units that are designed to hold storage cubes.These cubes are ideal for holding anything, especially nappies and toys so that it easy to tidy up after playtime. They could be used to store clothes or books or anything.  They have a cheerful print and would brighten up any child’s room and they would not look out of place in a living room. They are not particularly big yet they provide a surprising amount of storage capacity.","Toy BoxesLoved the overall look of these storage boxes. The colours and characters are adorable and they're nice and sturdy. Not only great for toys, books, games etc but these would also be ideal in a nursery to store nappies and fresh laundry.Pros * Convenient * Durable * Kid- Friendly * Lightweight * Lots of Storage * Quality ConstructionConsI really can't think of any.

I use reviews to help make decisions on whether or not to make purchases and therefore would not recommend a particular product or give it 5 stars unless I truly believe it deserved it.","The 4 Storage Boxes are the cutest! The quality is awesome! They are perfect for storing toys, games, clothes, shoes; anything that fits is perfect in them. I love looking at the little animals in my living room! The boxes are large and sturdy, yet soft enough if little falls on it.

We all know how hard it is sometimes to get kids to tody up so this was a great start.The boxes are a thick re-inforced canvas materia in nice neutral beige colour which really looks behind the bright, fun animal pictures. They are sturdy and very well made, so far they have stood up well to being tipped over and re-filled nearly everyday.Overall these are big, brilliant, quality storage boxes which have encouraged my daughter to be tidier, very impressed and would definetly consider these above anything else if I need to buy more in the future.I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review All words, pictures , videos (if applicable) and opinions are totally my own.

I was expecting it to be of much thicker material. However, it was extremely thin and looked as though it would easily split/tear. Additionally, on laying it out on my black leather sofa, whilst refolding it to return, I noticed afterwards that there was a large amount of white dust everywhere. I think perhaps this may be something to do with the pattern printed onto it, but it is not good and does makes you wonder how well it would wear in use.","Curtain was a bit plastic-smelling when first opened but is great after a few showers.

However, these little jars just rocked my world. I've tried many spice jars from the orginal containers to Ikea jars to wooden ones and every time for some reason they just do not float my spicy boat.However, these little gems have turned out amazing. I bought spice labels to go with them and now have a very pretty (and large) spice rack that is completely air tight, easy to store and easy to use. I've just ordered another box and I'm contemplating also using these for my cupcake sprinkles. They can also be used as mini preserve jars which are handy for little christmas gifts (just ask my work buddies who received a load of homemade jams and cranberry sauce as stocking fillers).Long live Kilner!",8 out of 12 jars fastened. The others were dodgy and did not work. I made chutneys as a present for friends. The seals were not reliable. Lovely to look at though,"Brilliant.I searched for ages, for jars that I could consolidate all the spices in the kitchen.These are a great size, and because they're square and not too tall, they sit neatly together in a standard kitchen drawer.I would recommend to everyone.",these are a decent size and a good price. they fit about 1.5 regular spice containers worth each and the flip lid makes them pretty air tight.

They were replaced by the seller, quickly with no quibbling, but the next batch did exactly the same thing.  It was agreed I would receive a refund as the cost of replacing the seals by mail again was more than the cost of the seals themselves - so no seals, no sale.  Disapppointing, as my jars meet the size criteria for the seals, but the seller was responsive and helpful during replacement and refund.","Having been ""gifted"" a set of what I'll generously describe as ""Kilneralike Jars"" a few years ago, which have proven themselves to be absolutely unsealable to the ruination of several attempts at making preserves with our own, precious, home-grown produce and since been relegated to the back of the big cupboard, which has become a graveyard for various pieces of useless kitchen tat (You know the stuff, it's hard to clean or functionally pointless, or both.

I secured the storage bag to the board with gaffer tape and hey presto it's easy to slide in and out from under the bed.Pretty substantial nylon material, well stitched with clear plastic top which is zipped on two short sides and one long side, with two zippers. There is a grab handle on one end AND on the long side for pulling in and out.Mine is being used for mens shoes, which just about fit in ~ a pair in each compartment, although one pair of largish boots I needed to spread over two compartments. Ladies shoes would be no problem. The compartments are fixed to the bottom of the storage bag by velcro strips, which you can move a bit if that helps.Obviously if the whole structure was more rigid (thus 4* rather than 5*) with the sides supported by card or similar it would be better (although fixing hardboard to the bottom has helped) ~ but then it would cost a lot more money!To me it seems like an excellent and cheap solution to a pile of shoes under the bed gathering dust!","I have bought 2 of these recently to tidy my shoe collection and they have done the job perfectly, you can fit 16 pairs of heals in but can fit it many more pairs if storing only flats(I managed 29 pairs!)

We don't expect to stay in our current house for too long so a unit requiring fixing to a wall or door was useless to us. For that reason alone this gets 5 stars.The spice rack is sturdier than I had expected. It uses up an insignificant amount of workspace but has freed up an entire shelf in our largest cupboard on which we can now stack our tins and jars. I would recommend buyers measure the space where they would like to put the rack before purchasing. It is to tall to fit between the worktop and wall cupboards in most kitchens and if free standing definitely needs to be against a wall. Once it is full it will take a significant force to push it over and feels secure on a flat worktop. We have filled it with a mix of supermarket own-brand and schwartz spice/herb jars both of which fit easily with room to spare. Only the taller non-standard sized containers like Schwartz Korma Curry Spice 90g can be a little difficult although they still fit with OK with some manoeuvring.My only criticism is the finish of the wood. It feels like it needs a bit of sanding so that it would feel a bit smoother although you can do this at home if you think it is worth it. Definitely highly recommended.Note this product is sometimes available in oak. We only saw this after we had ordered the pine version:Solid Oak Spice Rack Four Tier 44 Jar Capacity,"Holds all my standard size spice jars and looks really effective. I'm a keen cook and have a fairly large range of dried herbs & spices, so it's great to be able to access these easy and without raking through boxes or pulling a dozen jars out the cupboard before getting to the one I want. It also saves space in my cupboards - which is a definite win in a small kitchen!","I was looking for a spice rack that would look impressive, even though it is on the inside of my kitchen cupboard and this is the one. I got it in pine and it is not too heavy (my husband was worried about the strain the weight of this might put on the cupboard door) but it really is perfect. it holds 44 jars and I bought some plastic jars again to reduce the weight as 44 glass spice jars were heavy. I just want to show everyone who comes to my house my new and groovy spice rack. well worth the money opposed to the metal wire spice racks that are quite common and this fits perfectly on a 600 mm larder cupboard door",I'm delighted with this spice rack.  A real space saver which holds even more than 44 jars and is really  five tiers if you count the top of the unit.  Easy to install.

Would fit into any style of kitchen without problem so I would recommend it to anybody who needs this much spice-space in other words anybody who cooks real food!!!,I use so many herbs and spices that I had several spice racks lined up! This spice rack comes unpainted but ready-assembled. It holds most of my jars and sits very neatly between the wall- and floor-units in the kitchen.

However this is actually the Ikea grater, it even has the Ikea label still on it. There is therefore absolutely no way the original price was nearly £20 as suggested as Ikea sell these for under £3 so don't think you are getting a bargain as you aren't.  I was happy to pay more than double the Ikea price as it was delivered quickly to my door and saved me the cost of going to Ikea where I would certainly have bought things I didn't need. So five stars for the grater but 2 deducted for the unnecessarily misleading pricing.","Very useful being able to store grated cheese in the box it is grated into, saves washing up and looking for another box to store it.","I bought this cheese grater because I previously found grating cheese to be an awkward and uncomfortable chore. Thankfully, this product makes the process much more pleasant.FUNCTIONALITY- The base has a non-slip, rubber circle that helps the grater stay still on the worktop while you grate.- The container neatly collects the cheese, preventing it from spilling everywhere.- The two grating attachments are perfect for different types of cheese. For example, use the coarse grater for cheddar and the finer one for parmesan.- The lid means that you can easily store grated cheese in an airtight container, should you wish to prepare your cheese in advance of cooking.QUALITYThe metal graters and plastic tub with lid feel strong and well made/COLOURThe colour in the product image - sky blue - is an accurate depiction of the shade. It is very pleasing to the eye.VALUEI spent less than £7 on this product, which means it was much cheaper than many less practical graters. Excellent value.THE BOTTOM LINEAdds ease to grating cheese.",The grater is great but doesn't sit tight on the container it's too loose and the lid doesn't close it falls inside the container so not much point of it.,"I actually never use the smaller of the two graters but this is the second set I have bought. The previous one I bought may years ago and it lasted for a very long time. I hope this one will too. The blades seem really strong. The little bowl that catches the cheese is a nice size and I actually just store it like that in the fridge. It is one of those things everyone should have. The last cheese grater I bought on here a while back for my daughter and it was pricey (and fell apart). I would recommend this instead of those normal 4 sided stand up silver jobbies, they never last.","My mum has one of these and I love it. I have been looking for one for ages, until I just thought I have Prime membership and I could probably get one on Amazon with free delivery. It is so much cleaner than a regular cheese grater as all the grated cheese ends up in the tub rather than on on a plate and all over the counter. You can then put the tub on the table for everyone to get however much they want and after the meal, the sealed lid means I can put the leftovers in the fridge. Overall you get so much less wasted cheese, much less washing up and best of all I generally have enough in the tub in the fridge for a cheeky bit on my beans on toast.","Please note: this is actually an IKEA Chosigt grater.The grater plates and the lid fit the bowl okay. I wouldn't trust the lid on the bowl to keep juice in if it wasn't the right way up.The bowl is sturdy enough for grating and grips a work surface.The grater is fairly hard work and I have to keep changing the angle of the grated item for it to find teeth to bite.Some of the gratings and juice stay on top of the grater rather than all going through the holes and ending up in the bowl.Useful for travelling, but I wouldn't choose it for kitchen use.","A bit weird as the ""lid"" goes inside the outer rim. and though it works well, you do get cheese crumbs on the top of the grating surface which can be messy."

And when the set arrived I noticed instantly that they have removed the IKEA stickers and put their own on top, but obviously the plastic has IKEA branding still on them so it's easy to tell these are indeed from IKEA. A bit cheeky.I would give 1 star for getting 'slightly conned' on Amazon.But I will give 2 stars because they seem okay for IKEA quality and still better value than buying a single spatula for 5 pounds of local Sainsbury's,plus I really can't be bothered about a few quid.","Good for use on our new ceramic pans, not scratching the coating off like the metal ones, better for the stress factor between my husband and myself. The only thing I would say is that they are quite bendy and not for the heavy handed, otherwise they would have got to four star rating.",These are absolutely rubbish. The price is all wrong as well.

It is not a bread making or Christmas baking mixing bowl (29cm - 32cm). The website for Mason Cash provides specific information on bowl sizes. Mason Cash mixing bowls are well made and have that ""feel good"" factor when home baking.

I love that they are now introducing new colours. This medium sized bowl is in a gorgeous green (it is actually a good match for some Emil Henry dishes I picked up in France a few years ago -  the first time I have come across anything in a remotely similar shade). The pattern on the rim makes it easy to grip. I haven't had the bowl long enough to judge if it will last as long as my old faithful but it seems to me to be built to the same standard.",I love the pattern on this bowl and it sits on my kitchen table full of fruit.

You do get a better result if you follow the instructions and dampen the cellophane discs before fitting them to the jar.  The Kilner brand seems to be the best known when it comes to bottling and preserving, but as another reviewer pointed out, the cellophane discs seem to be getting smaller and give less 'cover' than previously.  I suspect that Kilner are trying to squeeze a bit more product out of their cellophane stock, but it is still a decent quality product.  It is useful to have both the cellophane covers and the elastic bands supplied together, it saves a lot of searching round the house for suitable bands!!","I've been making jams for years but recently it seems that the cellophane discs and getting thinner and smaller and the elastic bands seem to be of poor quality.  A 1lb disc now only just fits the top of a 1lb jar, with very little 'frill' below the rubber band.  I do like Kilner's products but I fear that the above may be happening to their discs too.","better than buying mixed packets of cellophane, wax and fancy printed paper tops that are neither use nor ornament. These ones do what they should and, after moistening with water and placing on warm jars, shrink to form a tight seal, unlike some shop's own brand ones","Should have checked the size of the cellophane discs -- about 4 inches diameter when I really wanted ones for smaller jars.  Also not sure about the elastics -- they are a sort of clear-ish yellowy-brown colour and not opaque, so I'm wondering if the bands have got old or if they're ok.  Will update when I come to use all this for jam-making at the end of August.","I made a couple of batches of marmalade this year that weren't very successful, so I decided to get back to basics. I have bought new equipment and am paying attention to detail to try to ensure I leave nothing to chance to prevent further mishaps. So I purchased these cellophane covers as part of my master plan and also the proper wax covers -  Kilner Wax Discs (Pack of 200)The cellophane will hermetically seal the jars if used properly. Apply it when the jars have just been filled, and slightly moisten the cellophane before securing with an elastic band. The cellophane will shrink slightly to form the airtight seal over the top of the jar.If nothing else, they will make my marmalade look more professional! But I'm going to stick to my trusty old recipe that worked so well in the past, instead of trying new ones that haven't worked.Fingers crossed......","This Kilner pack is very useful if you want to make jams, or preserve something.I love it. But in some places you can get it cheaper....when I saw it somewhere else cheaper I was very dissappointed how much more I payed here.",This is a good item that does the job.  But  for myself I don`t find the elastic bands a necessary inclusion.  Placing the covers over the jar and securing with the top works well without the bands.,"All as described, with good quality bands.  Nice strong covers, which didn't split when covering jars after I made some jam.  Delivered quickly too.  Can recommend.  Thank you."

B00YA48590,✮Special Offer✮ Luxury Kensington Kitchen Stainless Steel Garlic Press Bundle,"Cooking & Dining,Kitchen Tools & Gadgets,Garlic Presses",5,29.99,12.95,57,True,88,"As a former chef and someone who likes garlic I’ve used a lot of garlic presses over the years and half the time I’ve ended up doing the “squash it with a bit salt and chop and mince with a knife” method, mainly garlic presses are, generally speaking, “crap.”  They tend to suffer from the same problems as potato ricers (which, let’s face it is just a big garlic press) and they are: hard to clean, bits “squash up” the sides and don’t “mince”, just “not up to the job.”This is none of those, the garlic goes down and through leaving a minimum of residue behind un-minced (you’re always going to get a little, it doesn’t squirt up the sides in slivers and it’s good and robust and does the job.  Make no mistake this is the king of garlic presses and I find it absolutely brilliant.  Nice to see a product which does exactly what it’s supposed to do and does it properly.It also comes with a silicone sheet (you put a clove in it and roll it around and it peels it), I don’t think this is an original idea but it’s good to have.  It even comes with a little cleaning brush.Seriously now if you want a garlic press get this one, it really is excellent, ok it’s not the cheapest but it’ll last years (it’s very well made) and does the job so much better than any other garlic press I’ve EVER used and trust me, as a former chef, I’ve crushed one hell of a lot of garlic in my lifetime ….","Such a well presented luxury item from Kensington Kitchen. The black box it comes in has a magnetic clip (you can't see the clip but it is there) and the box is very neat and tidy with a moulded area for the press. There is printing describing it on inside the cover of the box. The press is nicely placed in a cut out section especially shaped like the garlic press. It fits in perfectly.Together in the box was the little brush for cleaning it which will prove to be very handy when cleaning it after use.The handle has the company name printed on it.I love garlic and cook with it in almost every dinner meal I make, so this will be very useful. I usually would chop garlic by hand but this will now save my hands from smelling like garlic.It works great and certainly is easy to clean, especially with this little brush, it just scoops out the bits that get stuck.Highly recommend this quality product and especially to give as a gift, it is very fancy and well presented.It has a lifetime guarantee and is dishwasher safe.I have added photographs for your convenience.***** I was kindly given this item in exchange for my honest review on the product, this is what I have provided here *****","CONTENTS.-----------------The Kensington Kitchen Garlic Press bundle comes supplied in a very high quality presentation style box with magnetic latch that makes this an ideal gift idea.Inside the box you will findThe garlic pressA cleaning brushA silicone garlic peeling roll.An invitation card to join the Kensington Kitchen VIP club.The instructions should you require them are printed on the inside of the box lid.MEASUREMENTS.-------------------------The garlic press measures 19.2cm long and 61.68mm wide at its greatest point.The handles measures 106.5mm long and 19.13mm in diameter.At the end of each handle is a loop for hanging, the internal measurements of these are 10.3mm x 13.8mm, given that the two handle do not lock together if you are going to hang the garlic press you will need to mount on both holes otherwise it will dangle down quite far.The opening for placing garlic in measures 22.4mm wide, 31mm long and the depth varies greatly as is sloped. The space is large enough for two cloves.The garlic press weighs exactly 264g.THE PRODUCT.----------------------The garlic press is largely made from non magnetic, corrosion resistant stainless steel. The perforated basket that holds the garlic is magnetic and I am unsure if this is steel or ferrite stainless steel. Even if it is the latter, it lacks the corrosion resistance of high quality stainless steel due to the carbon content of the metal and is something to be aware of.The handles are hollow and have a brushed metal effect finish with the remainder of the press having a highly polished mirror finish.Read more ›","I'd forgotten how useful garlic presses are - or maybe that it's that this one is so good.The 'cage' you drop the peeled garlic into is bigger than average,the big handles make for a comfortable and firm quality grip,the holes the garlic presses out of, give a decent sized grains of garlic - it's not just 'mush' like in some presses,the press is carefully engineered so that all the garlic clove presses through it, it doesn't just squash up the sides,It's very quick to use - I did a whole bulb of garlic, which was about 10 uses -  as small cloves can go in together - in about 5 minutes, which included the peeling, I then just covered the pressed garlic with a little oil in a jam jar in the fridge which will store for ages, and I will use as needed.The brush provided is great for washing up as it frees any garlic from the holes, quick rinse and it's done.This would make a great gift for any cook as it also comes beautifully presented.Highly recommended.",,,,

I thought I'd give it a go and I'm really glad I did.It zests lemons really evenly and within seconds and seems to produce double the amount of zest because it gets round the nobbly ends and doesn't leave half embedded in the grater. It might sound sad being amazed by a citrus fruit grater but honestly, try it and you'll see what I mean!","A few cookbooks that I own mentioned using ""a microplane"" as an easy way of preparing ginger and spices such as nutmeg.  After searching around, I was a little overwhelmed by the range of products offered.  After some research, it appeared that this was the tool that the books were referring to.  This grater/zester particularly excels at grating ginger into paste for use in curries and marinades, but is great for lemongrass, galangal and hard cheese.  It's easy to clean and has considerably less retention of foods than other graters that I have used.  It also comes with a plastic blade cover which is useful for protecting it when not in use.  It is very sharp, so care is advised when using it!  I use this item regularly and although it is a little pricey, I would recommend it wholeheartedly.","I'm italian and I always had graters in my house and were always the same for the past (maybe) century.This thing demonstrate that you can innovate even with these mundane things. Very smooth when you grate. The stylus form is brilliant in many occasions (you can easily grate directly on the plate).Works like charm, but beware fingers, as usual!Bought green because was cheaper! ;)","It works really well, the only minor problem is that you tend to get a bit of food stuck on the sides where the metal is folded.","And lightweight so easy to hold whilst grating lemons,limes etc.  Goes straight onto whatever you are preparing, no fiddly knife involved, just shake.  Cleans easily.  Just the job and a lot easier than my old square grater.","I have to say I would never have bought one of these on a whim as I have what I thought was a perfectly acceptable grater already so why spend nearly £15 on another particularly with a lime green handle YUCK!  However my big sis has one and was singing it's praises and I got to have a go with it when I visited.  It produces a perfect lemon zest ""crumb"" rather than long strands which is not too obtrusive in recipes.  It has two handy rubber feet to prevent it from skidding or you can just do it freehand, though be very careful as the blades on this are pure evil!  It also makes short work of nutmeg and parmesan.I would have preferred the pink one, but i would have felt like a complete sucker paying an additional £6 just for a pink handle so I went for austerity lime green instead which isn't so bad as it shows up well in my utensil draw which is predominantly black and stainless steel.It also comes with a guard which is sturdy and easy to put on.  Be sure to use it.Quality product.  Should last for a good while.","I saw Michael Symon use one of these on the Food Network for his lemons. It looked effortless, much different to my regular Microplane which I almost have to whip my wrist to zest, so I use that for cheese, chocolate etc..I checked prices of a few on here and decided on this one. £15 is a lot to spend on a grater, but this is truly amazing plus the colour is great, the first time I used it for lemons I was in chef heaven! Zesting was a joy and only needed very gentle pressure, outstanding!! I'm going to buy one for my sister and brother-in-law, I'm THAT impressed!! If you want to buy a fine zester, this is the one for you!","It does what it says on the tin. Great kitchen tool.great when using parmasan,lemons/limes.doesnt take up a lot of room in your kitchen draw either."

My problem is not with the item, but with the misleading and non-genuine RRP. The garlic press is in fact made by IKEA and priced at £2.25 (August 2013). The RRP of £29.95 appears to be a complete work of fiction, a cynical attempt to make customers believe they are getting a better bargain than is actually the case. Even with the supposed ""discount"" of over 80% the price you pay here will be more than twice the price at IKEA. There is no doubt this is the same item, even the photography being used is the same as on IKEA's website.I only found out that I had been swindled after I received and used the item for a few weeks, making a return difficult. I have contacted Amazon but they say nothing can be done, thanks Amazon. Unless you enjoy being swindled by charlatans save your money and get it from IKEA, it is called the KONCIS.",Very disappointing to find out that this is the £2.99 IKEA garlic press...  Looks good but bad quality. Buy another one.,"Haven't used the garlic press as of yet, but looks ok for the job.However, it comes still in the IKEA bag and costs about £2 in IKEA not the RRP of nearly £30. Even with postage the price of over £5 is way too high.As soon as I received it I immediately complained and received a discount.Have also complained to Amazon but from other comments not holding my breath.In essence, it looks like a good garlic press, but save some money and buy direct from IKEA.","I bought mine directly from IKEA (GBP2.25) but if your local is miles away from your home, it's cheaper to order from amazon seller. The press itself is very good and sturdy and there's no need to peel your garlic. Easy to clean and and hopefully will last a while.TWO WEEKS ON !!!!!!What a disappointment. Both handles came off after only 2 weeks of normal use. I also noticed that the handles are GLUED ON (metal on metal), so they just slipped off. I'll put some pictures up, so you can see what I'm talking about. VERY disappointing!","Absloutley mid-leading, the item is in fact from ikea, at a fraction of the price, it's packaged really Badly and they have had the cheek to leave the ikea label on it!  Going back ASAP!","The title says it all really, you can buy the same product at IKEA at more than half the price, mine even came with the IKEA label on it!Have reported it to Amazon, still no change, look on eBay or get it from IKEA!!Should be removed and reported to trading standards",A quick internet search revealed that this is exactly the same as KONCIS garlic press sold in IKEA for £2.25.I think it is actually illegal to put a false high RRP and AMAZON is partly liable as it allows such cons on its website.,It took nearly a month to come! It is an ikea garlic press which costs 2.75 shouldn't be allowed to sell it. Don't understand why Amazon is allowing this to happen. DONT BUY waste of money really really bad

I was given one of these from U.S.A. and recommend it to all cooks. Family think it is great too .  Nutmeg, parmesan, limes etc are so easily grated.  Easy to clean. Could not source it through high street shops but found it through Amazon. Well done. Amazon.","SEVENTEEN QUID! For a lemon zester?!Yes, on Saturday, that was my reaction, too.Except it's now Tuesday, and I've already got my money's worth. Even my short-armed Yorkshireman in the kitchen thinks this little piece of kit is worth its weight in gold.Like bacon, there are few things in life that lemon zest doesn't improve. Unfortunately, if - like us - you've been using an ordinary grater or peeler all your life, you'll have often skipped recipes that call for lemon or lime zest, because getting decent quantities of the damn stuff takes whole hours of your life, not to mention the skin off your knuckles.No more.This gadget will shave a lemon or a lime in just a few seconds, leaving a very satisfying pile of zest with no pith, and no annoying bits embedded in the grater holes to drive you mad either.We've now used it for three recipes in three days, and Great British Bake-off isn't even on for another hour.Just forget the price and get one. One bite of a lemon mayonnaise fishfinger sandwich says you won't regret it.","easy to hold, easy to use, never failing results for .....grated ginger, lemon zest, finely grated parmesan (yay!)grated nutmeg and/or chocolate on your cappucino....and many more","This is a nice piece of kit, well proportioned, practical to use and easy to clean.The graters are advertised as razor sharp and so they are, though the design is such that they are not a serious hazard to knuckles, finger tips or other body parts. They make it really easy to strip an orange, lemon or lime of its zest and only its zest, no pith (the fruit is left with a skin of the same colour as before, but paler and not shiny). I'm completely sold on the product and am now looking to avoid discarding any citrus skin without first stripping off the zest. Besides the traditional uses in cakes and puddings, I am trying it in other foods. The big successes so far are cocoa (cacao actually - strong, sweetened with honey, made with water, not milk, and a teaspoon of vanilla essence) and home-made tomato soup (the zest of one large orange divided between two bowls of soup). Tomato soup served this way is so good it ought to be listed as a 'legal high'.I have also tried the grater with chocolate. The result is very finely grated chocolate - but the task is nevertheless quicker and easier than with conventional graters. A little of the grated chocolate goes a long way, with the open surfaces optimised to give maximum smell and taste from minimum chocolate - a benefit on the calorie front even when cost is not an issue.Nutmeg and stem ginger are yet to come, but it won't be long. Then there will be horseradish....  I'm having so much fun with this.","The Ultimate Grater / Zester. If you had to buy just one.. Recommanded by professional Chefs where I work.I don't regret my purchase. Despite the price, it feels like a good investment and very sturdy.Mind your fingers with this !!!","This is a seriosuly good kitchen gadget and just what we were looking for after seeing it on various TV cookery shows. It's solid, feels good in use and so far has been great for rinding citrus fruits and finely grating parmesan - we've not yet tried it for chocolate, but when we do it will be just as good. The fiddly plastic cover does take a bit of getting used to, but since the tool is hardly ever out of service in a busy kitchen, there's no real issue.","After wanting a microplane for a long time, I was not disappointed by this one. The handle is comfortable to use and securely fastened and the plane itself -sharp! After zesting lemons on a normal blunt grater, the difference was amazing, the lemon floated along the microplane like butter.",took a long time deciding to buy the microplane - I took the plunge and no regrets - I use it most days - even got one for my son

The 'plastic/rubber' gripper ensures being able to grasp the hot jars safely and remove them from boiling water.,"Good, strong tongs.  Practised with them on an already processed 1lt jar of mulled pears, which was quite heavy.  I was able to pick them up safely with ease.  Very pleased with these tongs.  Can't think why I did not buy them before now.","For the first time this year,  I've undertaken making chutneys and pickles for small Christmas gifts. I have two great pairs of oven gloves, but taking the jam jars straight out of the oven and filling them is a fiddly, messy and time-consuming business. And the heat from the jars was starting to get through the gloves. I bought this to assist me with safer bottling.While it's fine for taking the jars out of the oven by their necks, I'm unable to use it to hold the jar for any length of time while bottling. The handles are so far apart that it's impossible to grip them with one hand while holding the jar firmly in place. Very disappointing.","Bought this and as instructed, washed by hand with warm soapy water before use.Next day founded all rusted.Says dishwasher proof, but obviously it isn't even water proof.","A tad clumsy to use, but essential when removing hot jars from sterilising pan.  Compares favourably on price. I also use it to close an awkward-to-each window!",My partner started making jam and bottling sauces this year and had a real struggle getting hot jars out of the oven and  saucepan of hot water so I'm hoping in the coming season he'll find life easier,"These are reasonably sturdy, and very effective, saving me from burned fingers and dropped jam jars.  I would recommend for anyone making jam."

Unfortunately I discovered that while Microplane make the best graters in the world (in my opinion!) they unfortunately also make the crappiest plastic mountings too. I went for this as it combines the stunningly sharp Microplane grater with a nice sturdy metal mount, which I am pleased to report is a marriage made in heaven.I can definitely recommend this product, but please learn from my mistake - if you want the finest grater you can buy don't try and economise by going for their cheaper range that are mounted in plastic, they will fall apart depressingly quickly.","It's the best type manufactured grater there is on the market to day, I have 3 or 4 of them and use them all the time.",I have three other Microplane graters in the Professional Series and I am VERY happy with them!

So placed it correctly in the holder (see photo), squeezed (it doesn't take a huge amount of strength) and found myself left with a completely voided orange and a small glass of juice.I only used a small orange - possibly if you had a large fruit you would have to segment it first.I found this a really good piece of equipment; I particularly like that it sieves out any pips.

Little did I know of the invention of the Microplane - this made zesting so easy... I had grated lemon zests within seconds and had a large quantity of it. I'm very impressed and pleased with how fine the grating was.It's not so good with garlic though... the garlic became mushy because of the liquid/juice... which makes it a bit of a mess (behind the zester). I think this will be great for dried foods like nutmeg, chocolate, lemon, orange...maybe even carrots or some other hard fruit.Yes, it is pricy - but I'm hopeful it will last many years... and it will be so worth it when it saves me time whenever I need to get lemon/orange zests. In the past, I would painstakingly zest a big amount so I could freeze them. The fact that the microplane makes short work of the zests in a matter of seconds... I don't have to prepare ahead anymore. It'll be a simple 1-2 min job should the recipe ever call for lemon/orange/chocolate zests... Have already felt it worth the money after the first use!","Having seen similar products being used by TV chefs, I fancied one for a Christmas present for myself.  I researched the reviews on Amazon for similar products and thought that I had ordered one with a black handle, however, it turned out to be purple.  This actually is an advantage, as it is extremely sharp and needs careful handling when selecting it amongst other utensils which have black handles.  It does a great job when zesting citrus, as it only removes a very fine layer from the peel. It doesn't work so well on an onion; it is too fine and results in a mush.","Even though this zester is a bit pricey, it's the greater zester of all times, much better than everything I've tried before.

So far, I have sifted flour, crushed flaxseed, chia seeds, sugar (there were some hard lumps I wanted to remove) and drained pasta and rice. It has sifted or drained them all well. I have found it to not be affected at all by heat or steam, and its rubber handle is easy to grip. The hole near the end of the handle is helpful if you were to have a hook for hanging kitchen implements; I do not have a hook however it does not detract from its utility by having a hole, and is helpful if you do have kitchen hooks.

It will survive a lot of bashing and mashing in the kitchen. I am hoping this lasts longer than the multiple others I have owned. You know what they say – “you buy cheap, you buy twice”. I am hopeful this will last into my old age. This seems to be built how things used to be built!I often use a colander to strain my veg and I sit it over the small sink and when I pour the boiling water with the veg in, the water splays over the draining board due to the design of holes going in all directions. I get told off for this! The sieve is actually saving me a reprimanding and some extra cleaning up!The wire is firm, strong and super resilient. The manufacturers offer a lifetime guarantee. The firm offer a 110% refund promise. As this is technically impossible, you should claim it! It will not rust as it is stainless steel. The mesh itself is super fine so it is superb for sifting flour, Matcha tea (which I use a great deal) and anything of a fine nature. The handle is a black rubber and provides an excellent grip so there are no visits to the Accident and Emergency Department. The sink rest at the head end acts as a handle too so can be hung up so won’t get in the way in your already-congested kitchen drawer.I should also mention the nut bag. I do not really have much of a use for this so gave it to my mother. She seems pleased with it and said it looks good quality.The sieve also acts as a good splatter guard when frying and conceivably also to protect fresh food left out in the open, although I have yet to do this. It washes perfectly in the dishwasher. There is a band called Half Man Half Biscuit who had a song called ‘Lock Up Your Mountain Bikes’.Read more ›","I shall try and make this short and sweet. I was on the lookout for a new sieve as I was getting sick of our existing plastic double mesh thing that every time you washed it in sink water it seemed to come out with more food and dirt on it than when it went in so when I was offered this MagiKuchen sieve at a discount in return for an honest review I was more than happy to accept the offer.This item is without doubt a very good sieve and on top of that you get a nut milk bag but to be honest I am unlikely to use that. The sieve itself looks high end and feels top quality. The fact that it made of a rust proof steel single mesh gives the benefits of obviously no rust but also no bits of food being trapped between two meshes. It is strong and does not deform or change shape when you put pressure on things to go through like with a spatula or teaspoon. It has a nice fine mesh size which allows you to sieve with confidence and the handle is nice and strong but also silicone which avoids it getting too hot meaning you don’t have to reach for another tea towel to pick it up. A nice touch is the fact that it has holes at either end to enable you to hang it as we all know there is never enough room in the drawers for bulky items like this. So in summary, it looks like a quality bit of kit and performs impeccably and on top of that it comes with a lifetime warranty which must mean the manufacturers are confident in it. As a little bonus you also get a special offer to buy another of their products online for 99p and if they are as good as this it should be a bargain but I have not done that yet. Overall it is an easy decision to give it a 5 star review.","This “Stainless Steel Fine Mesh Sieve” by Magikuchen arrives in a brown cardboard box in one of Amazon’s standard brown cardboard boxes. I was lucky enough to get this at a discount for providing an honest review.  The usual Amazon price for this product is just under £14.The sieve is a useful 20 cm in diameter and made from stainless steel and it has a heat resistant silicone handle. It feels very well made and solid. It rust proof and comes with a lifetime guarantee. It is dishwasher safe.Included in the pack is a nut milk bag – I have never come across one of these before but it is a food grade filter. From what I have read, you blend some nuts and water in a blender and then filter it through a bag like this to remove all the bitty bits. I am not sure it is something I shall use if I am honest as nut milk is available to buy almost everywhere.  But if I ever need a fine grade filter I am all set!The sieve can be used for any culinary use and the Amazon page suggests other uses such as cleaning a sand pit or swimming pool.All I can say is that this is a very well made sieve and it sieves food, drains tin vegetables such as beans and lentils perfectly well. I have used it to steam vegetables and washed it in the dishwasher. It is very well made and a good everyday size.",,,,

As well as garlic, this press works on ginger too.I was offered this product at a reduced cost in return for my honest review. Overall I cannot fault it. It is a well-designed, robust kitchen gadget that has been built to last.",This product is well made - I owned a plastic garlic presser and this stainless steel 1 was definitely the better choice as it will last a life time. It presses garlic simply and effectively. It is was exactly as described and very easy to clean. It will go nicely with the rest of my Dinachef products! Great seller!*I got the product at a discount in exchange for my honest review*,"I am sorry to say we are disappointed with this garlic press. It feels flimsy when you squeeze the two handles together as if they might snap, we had only used this twice so far so may be an unfair comment as it hasn't snapped. Also after first squeeze of garlic clove, when you lift handle to place second clove, the removal section lifts with it so you need to push it back down into place before squeezing can continue. It's not a cheap press but feels like it in your hands I'm afraid.",,,,,

It is not a bread making or Christmas baking mixing bowl (29cm – 32cm). The website for Mason Cash provides specific information on bowl sizes. Mason Cash mixing bowls are well made and have that “feel good” factor when home baking. The Mason Cash mixing bowls are robust, easy to use when cake making and straightforward to put in the dishwasher. This particular bowl does all of that and the woodland scene of the owls on the outside of the bowls are just endearing. Makes me smile when cake making!Good price and excellent service from Heritage.","I liked my new mixing bowl - light and just the right size for me but within 2 weeks it chipped very easily, then when I used my electric hand mixer it left steel marks on the inside of the bowl…a bit disappointed about that.

The length is great sticks well and is easy to clean. Received item as expected happy with purchase and would definitely recommend seller.,"Fab for the bath, I made the mistake of leaving it there all the time & it is turning black in places on the bottom. Will probably buy a second, but dry it off after each bath so it doesn't go manky.",Great value and still going strong four years on! All the suction pads are still sticking firmly to the bath and my son loves it. A great colourful and fun bathmat that any child would love.,This is great with lots of suckers so it doesn't shift at all! It's a good length although not the full length of our bath but it fits from one end of the bath to the start of the plug area so that's fine as our 2 year old doesn't venture to the plug area as we sit him up the other end facing the taps and plug area. He loves his crocodile and knows to wait until it's in the bath before dumping all his toys into the bath while the water's running! I suppose in an ideal world it could be a tiny bit wider but it's absolutely great and you can put it in the washing machine periodically so no going mouldy! Definitely the best we have found on the market.,"This is a great addition to bath time in the 'grown-up' bath. The little ones can splash about without slipping over, so they feel and are safe in the water. It's  fun shape is also a source of all sorts of bath time stories for the imaginative. Make sure to stick it down firmly to the bath surface. The hole in the tail is perfect for hanging the mat up to dry between baths.","a good coverage of the bath tub with the perfect shape that covers both the length and the width. been using it for almost a year and the product does not use much sign of wear. our son became too active in baby bath (our 2nd baby bath tub, after the tippy toe new-born baby bath) around 9 months and the bath time became a real mess with splashed water everywhere. we switched his bath time to 'our' bath tub with this product and it was a very good decision. in retrospect, we should have switched as soon as the baby could sit up confidently, without buying the 2nd baby bath tub.","Sticks well to bottom of bath and looks cool although my son still slips on it?  Not ideal for a slip proof bath mat, suppose it's better than having nothing at all!"
B0001K9PUU,Draper 14037 35 mm Hinge Hole Cutter,"Substores,Regular Stores,DIY & Tools: Amazon Global Delivery Available",4,9.19,6.95,24,True,33,Very good for cutting the holes you need for flat-pack furniture hinges. Should only be used in short bursts as the sides of the disc start to heat up the sides of the hole. Does the job well though.,"I purchased this item to drill new hinge recesses in my Ikea doors for a bespoke wardrobe.Initially I was concerned the point in the centre of the bit would protrude too far from the main cutter and therefore go through the door before the recess was deep enough.  In the end it was fine - around 4mm spare so it's safe to use on Ikea 18mm doors!It cut very well using a cordless drill, my tip is to ever so slightly lean it one way and the next to encourage it to bite into the surface.  It cut well and the finished product was perfect.  Can't go wrong.",Tested it on a piece of timber first - wobbled a bit and quite hard to cut.  Had no choice but to use it on the laminate door and it cut perfectly and easily with just a hand-held drill.  I used a drill-driver which with its very slow speeds compared to a drill made for good control.,"This cutter did the job and is great for the price. However, after just 3 holes, it started showing signs of losing the sharp edges. If you need to cut a lot of holes, you may wish to consider a more robust and more expensive product.",I bought this as my kitchen cabinet door didn't have the mounting holes for the hinges. I used a rechargeable drill with it for better control. I was impressed with the sharpness of the product and it's ability to cut efficiently. However as I used it only on one door I cannot comment on how many doors it would cut although it remained very sharp (as new) after I had cut both holes. I would recommend this product for both quality and great value.,"a good and handy little bit!, i used it on 15mm mdf to make new kitchen doors, was pleased with the results","You get what you pay for!! If you intend to cut no more than a few hinge rebates, then it will just about do. If you want a decent tool to do the job with precision, you'll need to pay at least double and probably treble. Take great care and you should be o.k. I only needed to cut two holes, so it was a reasonable purchase. Can't fault Amazon for delivery.",We bought this and also one that was much cheaper but was being shipped from China.This one arrived first and was a disaster. The pointy bit at the bottom poked through our oak door before the wide bit had cut a hole deep enough for a standard hinge.We had to buy a new door.By the time that arrived so had the cutter from China and it has a much shorter pointy bit - so you can cut the hinge home (for a standard Blum hinge) without poking through the front of the door.

The lights and cable cover are made of a very durable soft plastic. The lighting effect control box runs in line approximately 50cm from the power plug, then another 2.9m down the power cable from the lighting effect control box hangs the first string of lights. There are 10 strings of lights and are evenly spaced through the length of the power cable and down the strings.The lights shone brilliantly with a warm white colour temperature and were warm to the touch. The lighting effect control box has a fan shaped dial with 8 lighting modes listed on it. Apart from the IN WAVES effect (which appears to be the only solid light mode) the rest of them worked beautifully with flashing and fading effects.Make sure you leave ample time to uncoil the fairy lights for its first use.Here's my YouTube video (https://youtu.be/FwSm7A2tCCI) unboxing, closeup look and testing the fairy light's lighting modes.",These light are amazing they made my Christmas. So nice I am gonna keep them up all year round.,"Bought as Christmas lights for large bay window. Working perfectly, good price and quick delivery. So nice will use in another room for rest of the year.","Unfortunately there is no band that the lights dangle from so when you unroll it, there is no obvious way to hang it.,  I was looking for a 'curtain' that I could tack to the top of the window with the strands hanging down and now I just have a mess of tangled lights after trying to hang them for an hour. Poor design to be honest.",I fitted these lights outside for 2 weeks over Christmas. When I took them down approximately60 have rusted inside the plastic. It's surprising water is getting in as the lights come with IP44 rating. I don't know if the lights will be working next year and some may be glowing orange rather than warm white.,Look lovely up after the untangling,"1) No instructions how to open the package and untangle the lights! 2) Once i finally managed to put them up outside ( it said internal & external use ), after 2 weeks five of the strings of lights did not work any more!!",Lights came well organised for ease of hanging. I used small 3m hooks for each of the 24 strands. Light options are good but the setting of always on gets reset to combination when powered off which is annoying.

I have three of these spaced across the rear of the new extension on our 1930's house. They look fantastic. Very unusual design in my opinion. Reminiscent of a cross between art deco and HR Giger. They're aluminium, so will never rust, and the alu is lacquer coated.I fitted these with dimmable 20w CFL bulbs, with an equivalent of 100w incandescent. They take a minute to reach full illumination, but work fantastically well, lighting up the immediate patio and garden space.",I bought two of these to replace old bulk head outside lights. Upon opening the box i was immediately impressed by the quality of the units. All lacered aluminium with a white plastic diffuser sealed by a rubber gasket. The wires fit in from the rear so it is flush to the wall. Screws and basic rawl plugs for wall mounting are included. The cable entry hole is slightly off to the right and has a rubber gasket for you to bring the cable in through providing a seal. The lamp holder is clay and good quality and the wires simply attach via screw terminals clearly labelled L and N (live and neutral) with an earth connection point just below the lamp holder. The front half holds the plastic diffuser in place by two screws. I found one of the screws would not go in all the way so i removed it and cut 5mm off to shorten it. So overall a very easy fit and looks amazing. It takes an ES (screw) lamp and i opted for a minisun LED lamp which is very low power but instant light. I would recommend this - i think for the quality you get its a bargain.,Lovely modern/retro looking light - great quality and well made - have used as a ceiling light in the porch - throws out a good amount of light - excellent - may get some more for the back of the house. Could also look good indoors in the right setting.,"Good quality,looks great easy to install. Not cheap but for the quality and finish definitely worth the purchase... would buy again. if i had to criticize one minor aspect, it would be great if somehow the globe was centrally installed instead of to the left, this offering equal light across the front of the lens. Instead it is dark on the globe side. Very Minor!! very pleased.",,,,

Doesn't make me sweat like some can according to other reviews. Bought for pregnancy in case waters broke in bed...would have been very useful if they had as would have ruined the mattress having seen what a mess it made of the floor! Now useful for protecting mattress from leaking milk and baby's vomit etc. Would recommend - only draw back is it comes off the corners of the bed easily and have to replace every morning. we have ikea king size mattress which might be why as slightly different dimensions.,"I have a toddler and am pregnant again, and I wash I'd bought this product before my first baby was born. I bought it to protect the mattress from baby sick and other nasties associated with little ones. We have an Ikea bed, extra large kingsize with a deep mattress, and so getting fitted sheets to stay on can be difficult. We've been using this waterproof sheet under a fitted sheet for about a week now, and the corner has only come off once and was really easy to pull back on - easier than the sheet alone. Good quality, silent and cool (even with a sweaty baby between us!), this sheet isn't the cheapest, but is worth the money for its reliability. We haven't had to test the waterproofing yet, thank goodness, but I'm just about to buy another one anyway for when this one is in the wash. I might get one for our other beds too, as mattresses are so expensive. You can't tell it's there, which is about as good as these things get, I think.UPDATE: Is waterproof for both toddler sick and toddler wee - a stressful evening!",i ordered the deep terry towelling mattress protector and it was brilliant it fits over the memory foam mattress's and is of good quality. Iwould definately reccomend this product.  L. Thomas,"the best mattress protector ive ever had and good quality ,does not slip about and you dont feel sweaty because of the terry toweling, good quality edges that will easily cover a deep mattress of 20cm plus.fantastic for the price too.takes a while to dry because of the materials so outdoors is best but despite this a great product.","I purchased this warterproof matress cover and I must say it does what it says on the pack. It has kept my mattress like new, and I think it is very hygeinc. As it has a toweling layer over the waterproof backing it doesn't make you sweat unlike other waterproof matress covers. I recomend this product.","Over the last twelve months I've bought 3 mattress protectors, two of them costing more than this one. The one thing they've all had in common is that the side skirts have been made of such a third rate material that it makes wet tissue paper seem like carbon fibre in comparison. Now at last, a mattress protector that is not only strong, very well made, stays in place and is very comfortable, but also excellent value for money. If you've experienced the same problem, look no further; this is the one to buy.","This is a BRILLIANT mattress protector, it stays in place easily & makes no noise at all when insitu. It is also of good quality & would not be damaged easily. I have had other waterproof protectors in the past & they were very noisy (like sleeping on a plastic bag), moved around a lot & the Silent night one I had ripped as soon as I put it on the bed due to the flimsy skirting. I would not hesitate to buy another of these protectors & am beyond happy with my purchase. BUY IT!","We bought this to protect a memory foam mattress. We haven't tested waterproofness but it looks good quality and fits perfectly despite the mattress being deeper than average. It doesn't feel plasticky at all, but unlike what others say here, it rustles when you rub the sheets, but you get used to it -- I am guessing other waterproof protectors are a lot noisier than this."

Instead you get an item that you can find cheaper elsewhere. The one i am attaching in the pictures. Not a Bosch not an Electrolux nothing as advertized and you can see in the picture.,Bought this as a replacement for the exact same one which seemed to have disappeared after 10 years of use.  Very good item.  No problems with it at all.  Did buy some extra blades this time as I couldn't seem to find them locally (and pre computer era in my house).  Probably why it disappeared in the first place!,"This scraper arrived with the blade holding end slightly bent, making the blade ends/sides dig into the hob while the center did not even touch the hob - rendering the item useless for cleaning & likely to scratch the hob. Not wishing to do a DIY job on this scraper, I have returned the item. Regarding the functionality of the scraper had it not been defective - well the safety guard is not at all easy to slide - so I will not be re-ordering the same model.I really cannot see how or why this model in particular would be recommended by Neff, Siemens, etc","Just got my first ceramic hob and managed to make a mess the first time I used it. No amount of cleaner would get rid of the marks & I was about to give up and go back to my old gas hob when I checked online and read loads of comments about this problem with ceramic hobs. Most suggested buying a scraper so I chose this one from Amazon and I'm really glad I did. I was a bit wary about using it at first as I was worried about scratching the hob surface. I needn't have worried though, it worked like a charm and my hob looks like new again. Really pleased with it.","Not having had a hob before I wasn't quite prepared for how grubby it got, and how quickly it built up. OK so maybe it's not as visible as it would be on a white top but it's still annoying.The only niggle I have so far with this scraper is that sometime the blade guard slips back into place when I'm using it and I don't realise for a minute that this thing is not actually being very effective because the blade it covered. Also I'm glad to see that this can be used either way round.I got this in conjunction with TOPRENS Ceramic Hob Cleaner to clean my newly delivered brand new cooker.These 2 items work well together and as others have mentioned, there are no remaining scratches. I actually quite enjoy cleaning my hob now. I'll have to buy some new blades soon, these are the recommended ones - Pack Of Ten Spare Blades For Ceramic Hob Scraper CLM1013.",Great little scraper. Meant to buy one when first got the cooker (10 months ago) and had been using only a hob cleaner fluid and kitchen roll. Therefore I didn't think I could remove old marks from the hob but this scraper removed all the old marks too! No effort needed-just gentle scraping at a slight angle. No scratches which I'd been nervous about! I now use it regularly and it's brilliant. My hob now looks as good as it did the day I bought it. Excellent product.,I thought this was a genuine bosch tool but it came in a plain wrapperExceptionally sharp and am frightened it will scratch the glass,"I bought one of these  scrapers as i always have problems with marks on my hob, I read the reviews from other customers, but i am very disappointed with it, i was expecting to be able to remove the marks on my hob, it did scrape some of them off but did not leave it all smooth.I have persevered with it for a few weeks but to no avail.I found it very difficult to actually get the right angle for the blade to scrape the hob.  I am now at a loss how to clean my hob, have tried various creams etc.!"

The pictures of these looked good and they also looked modern, but as a lot of us know, an item can look completely different when it's in ones hand.It was the exact opposite with these lights though because as it turned out, the pictures actually didn't do them justice. They looked fantastic and felt nice and sturdy.When fitted, they really look good on the wall and that's only during the daylight. They look even better as night and we've gotten a lots of comments from the neighbours, saying how well they look and asking where we bought them.I fitted a polished chrome 2 digit house number underneath one of them and the down light really makes it sparkle at night.Overall I'm absolutely delighted with them and so is my wife, who is taking all the credit from the neighbours for being the one that picked them out.","We are very pleased with these lamp units, we bought eight of them for the outside of our house and they look fantastic and very modern looking.

Received positive comments from others on how well they look.  The are a feature. Note: their design means they don't light up the garden area extensively like a security light or spotlight would but they're not meant to. They shine up and down the wall beautifully.,"I do not understand any of the reservations expressed in the 1 star review of this product. The lamp looks good and there are no gaps to be seen! I gave it 4 stars because the GU10s supplied fail in no time at all, some within days - I have 4 of them; I have changed 75% of the bulbs and they are not the easiest lamps in the world to replace the bulb in."

It started breaking for me within mere weeks of purchasing and use. Within that time I found the arms started to become loose from their sockets and the chair rocked abnormally on its piston (not the normal rocking, this was clearly where it was not seated correctly on the piston). I reported this to the seller including a video of the problems and they pretty much fobbed me off.Now within about 6 months of use these issues have become worse and now the wheels are starting to break off. I may have to replace soon which is entirely too short a lifespan for such a product.Only reason I have not given it 1 star is because at least the leather material appears to have remained intact.","The arms were wobbly when it arrived and shorting after fell off. They can be put back on but just come loose again within a couple of days. After a few months the pleather became hard and cracked and started to peel off. And finally the chair squeaks. I couldn't expect much more for the price for this design, but still I'd recommend just paying a bit more for something more durable.","I am amazed at this, i ordered it on a Wednesday and Friday it turned up so talk about speedy.... i had a small problem with one bolt not wanting to play ball, but we sorted it out, and the chair is comfy as hell, 10/10","I had high hopes for this product after many good reviews.  I found the chair wasn't level when built which was very annoying, to be fair to the company I didn't complain as i didn't want the hassle of changing it.  Its probably the type of chair (gaming) but I don't find it very comfortable.  Its neat and the moving arms is a great feature.  Next time I will go back to staples and pay a bit more and road test.","Nearly 5 months down the line the chair seems to lean at 30' degree angle and was not level on purchase, and the arms needed to be tightened every 4 weeks as they started to wobble. cant see how this product would of ever sold at the retail price of £399 as i feel ripped off for £85...","Looks great in sons new room, really comfy, easily adjustable, great for gaming on the PC, would liven up a room / office amazing quality and vibrant colours!","Good price good quality, slow delivery not amazingly good but okay, I would still recommend saving a little more and getting a better chair though :)","Not too bad, a bit rickety now and then but as soon as the bolts are re-tightened it feels very solid again."
