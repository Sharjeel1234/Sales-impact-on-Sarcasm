Sometimes IKEA gets it right, but all too often they fail and this is one of those times. It's a fail of design over function, and in the word of dish drainers function is pretty much the critical factor.This product fails for the following reasons:The V angle created is more than 90 degrees. Most mugs have a 90 degree angle at which they naturally rest, so when placed in this rack they rest on only one edge, not two making them unstable. So unstable in fact that they will happily roll along the central V and right off the end and smash seamlessly on the floor.The bottom tier is to small for many mugs and far too small for any plates. Plus it's really hard to wiggle things in and out when there is effectively a 'roof' above.The fact that it's two tier means then even when empty it makes the kitchen look cluttered.The V design means that there is large amount of space under the V which is inaccessible. This actually reduces the amount of capacity below that of just having your bare draining board.It's made of poor grade chrome plated steel which rusts easily.It folds away. When do you ever want to fold away a device you use three times a day? And where are you going to put it when it's folded?The top V is formed by inter weaving metal wires - like locking your fingers together - the result is that small plates fall straight through the slots on one side of the rack while large plates (that need to rest in the slots on either sides) can't do well because the slots are offset from each other.Really this is perhaps one of the worst crimes of design I've come across.Spend a little more and get this instead:Black Plastic Coated Large Plate Dish Drainer(also available in white in Bob Dyas)","Broken on delivery and not all parts came with it, so had to buy something else!",,,

This is flat pack, so prepare yourself for some effort.  I'm good at flat pack, I put together my Ikea kitchen with only a few hiccups.  This however takes flat pack to a whole new level.  The wooden pieces are so rough I expect to be pulling splinters from my fingers for the next week.  The instructions were followed to the letter and the finished result is terrible.  I've purchased two of these and they are both wobbly, not fit for purpose and nothing like the description.1. the wheels fall off when you move it.2. The flat pack pieces do not go together easily as the holes have not been drilled properly.3. There are 8 screws for every drawer - make sure they are at an exact 90 degree angle otherwise the wood will splinter and you will have an ugly screw poking into your drawer.4. The whole thing is wobbly - not sturdy or robust.5. The lacquered finish is a joke - you can see the wood through the white finish.6. Smooth running drawers, they are very basic wooden runners, the quality of wood is so poor they are not smooth.7. From the front I can clearly see the unfinished (so wood no white lacquer) drawer runners.All in all these have been a complete waste of money.I recommend buying something else if you want a drawer unit that is fit for purpose.","The wood is cheap and splits as you try to put it together.

In  the end, the one leg costs us nearly 6 times the store price (taking into account the loss of the wood box). Of course we could have driven back to the store (45' each way) to avoid that. Instead, we just decided to never again purchase something from Ikea. This way, we can amortise the cost of this lesson over the remainder of our lives.

B00GMM8M5U,"IKEA FINTORP - Rail, nickel-plated - 57 cm","Furniture,Living Room Furniture,Cabinets",1,0,15.53,0,0,True,1,"Looks nice, but a nightmare to fit.  You have to mark the 4 screwhole positions on the wall you have chosen before doing anything else, but it's largely guesswork as no template or measurements are provided to guide you.  The main problem is that the roundhead slot screws are slightly too large a diameter to fit easily over the the keyhole-shaped slots, meaning that not only is it nearly impossible to get the mounting plates over the screws. And if you are lucky enough to be able to manage that, you then realise that if the screws are not 101% perpendicular to the wall, the rail becomes absolutely impossible to fit.Oh, and did I mention that to fit the rails to the mounts, the screws have to sit a certain distance proud of the wall? Except the exact distance is also guesswork, so you have to take the rail on and off a number of times to get the screws the required height for the rail to be  a snug fit. Now combine that with rail mounting holes that are too small for the screws, and this excuse for a product will more than likely end up keeping the tins of baked beans and milk cartons company in your recycling box.This product could easily be made to work by doing away with the concealed fittings, have the mounting holes countersunk on the front of the brackets, and supply small circular blanks to cover them up when fitted. It would solve all the issues and reduce fitting time by 90%.As it stands, this is a waste of metal and packaging.",,,,
